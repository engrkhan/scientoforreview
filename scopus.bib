	abstract = {The study determined the association of follicle sizes and estrous manifestations with pregnancy of the two Fixed Time Artificial Insemination (FTAI) protocols and evaluated the factors that can influence pregnancy outcome in water buffaloes. A total of 285 riverine buffaloes were subjected to either Controlled Internal Drug Release-Synch-human Chorionic Gonadotropin (CIDR-Synch-hCG) or Select AI Protocol. For CIDR-Synch-hCG protocol, buffaloes were administered with GnRH with insertion of CIDR on Day 0. Prostaglandin (PGF2α) was given on Day 7 with the removal of CIDR. The hCG was given on Day 9 and AI was performed on Day 10. For Select AI protocol, the procedure was similar to CIDR-Synch-hCG except that insemination was done either on Day 9 or Day 10 based on the size of the pre-ovulatory follicle. Follicle sizes were taken using ultrasound on Days 0, 7, 9 and 10 and estrous signs were taken on the Day of AI. Pregnancy diagnosis by ultrasound was done around Day 40 post-AI. Findings indicated that there is a significant correlation between follicle size on the day of AI, estrous signs, and FTAI protocol with pregnancy. Select AI protocol resulted in a significantly higher (P<0.05) pregnancy rate (55.26%) compared to the CIDR-Synch group (44.71%). Logistic regression analysis likewise revealed that Select AI protocol, pre-ovulatory follicle size on the day of AI, and estrous signs are significant factors on the success of FTAI program in water buffaloes. The present findings provide valuable information for optimizing reproductive success not only in water buffaloes but in other livestock as well. © 2025, Chiang Mai University - Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.

The profound economic ramifications of LSD further underscore the importance of efficient diagnosis. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a transformative solution, pivotal in providing swift detection capabilities. Rapid identification of LSD not only mitigates economic burdens but also hinders the disease's spread within herds. A pioneering approach involves the utilization of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) in tandem with VGG16 for feature extraction, tailored explicitly for LSD diagnosis. This strategy is adept at discerning intricate patterns in disease manifestation, achieving a good accuracy rate of 96.5%. The model's effectiveness is evident in its ability to differentiate between infected and healthy cases with high precision, recall, and F1 score metrics, highlighting its reliability as a dependable tool for accurate LSD diagnosis and intervention.

	abstract = {Large quantities of chlordecone-based insecticides were produced and used throughout the world. One of its most important uses was to control the damage caused by Cosmopolites sordidus in banana-growing regions. In the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, 18,000 ha of farmland are potentially contaminated. Despite the key role played by soil macrofauna in agroecosystems, there are currently no data on their contamination. The aim of this study was to explore the fate of chlordecone (CLD) and its transfer to different organisms of the soil food web. Seven species of invertebrates representing different taxonomic groups and trophic levels of the soil communities of Martinique were targeted and collected in six experimental banana fields, with a level of contamination within a range of values classically observed. Soil samples and macrofauna from the study sites were analysed for CLD and chlordecol (CLDOH) its main transformation product. The contamination of the soil fauna were related to δ15N (trophic level), proportion of soil ingestion (diet) and types of epidermis (mucus or exoskeleton) in order to study the different mechanisms of macrofauna contamination. Presence of CLD and CLDOH could be quantified in all the soil organisms from contaminated fields. Results showed a significant relationship between the CLD contamination of detritivorous and the ash content of their faeces, suggesting that soil ingestion was the main contamination pathway. In contrast, the exoskeleton-bearing diplopod Trigoniulus coralinus and the soft-bodied earthworm Eudrilus eugeniae, both detritivores with a comparable diet, had similar contamination levels, suggesting that the type of tegument has little influence on bioaccumulation. At the scale of the entire trophic network, a significant relationship was uncovered between δ15N values and CLD contamination of the fauna, therefore providing some in situ evidence for a bioamplification process along the soil food chain. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Livestock farming is experiencing a digital transformation and is becoming more information-driven. However, this type of data is often kept in separate storage towers, making it incapable of practicing its potential to boost animal welfare. Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a serious threat to the health of cattle worldwide and has caused financial problems for many cattle farming enterprises. It has been shown that combining machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) with biosensor data and conventional visual inspections can improve the identification and diagnosis of this serious condition. Methods: This study presents an extremely precise livestock farming framework that combines data streams from a wide array of disciplines of dairy cattle to see if ever wider/vast data sources enhance the overall projections for diseases and if using the more complicated prediction models can reimburse for less diverse data to some extent. Using images from the farming landscape, this study highlights the utility of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the identification of the Lumpy Skin Disease Virus (LSDV) in animals. Result: An analysis of the relative weight given to individual factors in predicting accuracy shows that disease in dairy cattle results from the intricate interactions between many life domains/parameters, such as housing, nutrition and climate; that prediction performance is enhanced by incorporating a wider range of data sources and that current information can be repurposed to produce useful information for vaccine development. The study highlights the potential of data-driven dairy interventions, focusing on artificial intelligence for disease prediction in cattle, to improve animal welfare and reduce the risk of disease. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model effectively classified skin conditions with an overall accuracy of 73.89% after 27 training epochs. This study demonstrates CNN’s useful applications in the field of veterinary medicine by highlighting its potential for early detection of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD). © 2024 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {Agriculture provides human facilities through raising plants and livestock. Agriculture fuels a sedentary lifestyle. Smart agriculture is new, and a number of farmers do not know what it means. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) known as “computer vision” analyzes visual data such as digital pictures, movies, and other visual inputs to form conclusions and recommendations. Computer vision is revolutionizing agriculture. Livestock, poultry, and fish farms should supply foods like meat, milk, eggs, and offal as 30% of the daily protein requirement. Thus, we require a precise and timely animal count. This technology makes cattle tracking and counting easy. Assessing and managing poultry welfare requires monitoring. Computer vision’s wide variety of information and being non-intrusive make it an exciting new method for automating online poultry tracking and health monitoring. Reproduction in the aquaculture industry will require intelligent feeding methods in the future; its implementation will also be a priority. Computer vision as an intelligent feeding system is also evolving rapidly. The merging of the two systems will improve the state of aquaculture, and its potential growth depends on technology innovation and execution. Computer vision models can assess cow, pig, sheep, and hen closed-circuit television (CCTV) feeds to guarantee the best possible living conditions and social well-being. Insights can be gained via automating home management, analyzing behavior, predicting or detecting diseases, measuring weight, checking eggs for defects, counting fish, and so on. These AI-powered robots feed animals, collect eggs, and clean dung. After removing eggs that are near hatching, cracked, or unclean, they may count and package them automatically contain feathers and blood. Drones can observe environmental changes; offer fish stock statistics; and measure water oxygen, pH, salinity, and pollution. Farms and robots can use fish hunger sensors to better feed their fish. The ability for veterinarians to have continuous and potentially remote access to the data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) embedded in the animals opens interesting possibilities for teleconsultation or tele-expertise capable of optimizing the health and well-being of the animals, especially in areas of medical deserts that are also used daily in non-desert areas.

	abstract = {The impacts of climate change on agricultural production are becoming more severe, leading to increased food insecurity. Adopting more progressive methodologies, like smart farming instead of conventional methods, is essential for enhancing production. Consequently, livestock production is swiftly evolving towards smart farming systems, propelled by rapid advancements in technology such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, big data, machine learning, augmented reality, and robotics. A Digital Twin (DT), an aspect of cutting-edge digital agriculture technology, represents a virtual replica or model of any physical entity (physical twin) linked through real-time data exchange. A DT conceptually mirrors the state of its physical counterpart in real time and vice versa. DT adoption in the livestock sector remains in its early stages, revealing a knowledge gap in fully implementing DTs within livestock systems. DTs in livestock hold considerable promise for improving animal health, welfare, and productivity. This research provides an overview of the current landscape of digital transformation in the livestock sector, emphasizing applications in animal monitoring, environmental management, precision agriculture, and supply chain optimization. Our findings highlight the need for high-quality data, comprehensive data privacy measures, and integration across varied data sources to ensure accurate and effective DT implementation. Similarly, the study outlines their possible applications and effects on livestock and the challenges and limitations, including concerns about data privacy, the necessity for high-quality data to ensure accurate simulations and predictions, and the intricacies involved in integrating various data sources.

	abstract = {This paper presents a vision system that can be deployed in a ROS2 node that identifies potential predators such as wolves in order to herd autonomously a flock. A pre-trained YOLOv8 model and a pre-trained YOLOv9 model have been fine tunned so as to include more classes that are not supported such as wolves, and the whole models are re-trained with the COCO dataset and the new one, keeping the recognition of the previous learned classes as well as the new ones. To do that a dataset of images of wolves in open spaces has been acquired and labelled for instance segmentation purposes. The obtained vision model is wrapped in a ROS2 node, making it possible to implement it in a robotic device either a 4-legged robot or a rover robot. With this vision-based model, a robot can determine if a potential predator is detected and provide useful information to the herder to avoid area where the flock is in danger. Extensive livestock farming can benefit from the use of this technology to facilitate the tasks required on a daily basis. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {The confluence of artificial intelligence (AI), agricultural science, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionised the cultivation, management, and optimisation of agricultural operations in recent years. This examines these convergent technologies' changing environment and growing significance in contemporary agriculture. Precision agriculture, where data-driven decision-making enables farmers to maximise yields, minimise environmental impacts, and eliminate resource waste, has been ushered in by the convergence of IoT and AI. We explore the various uses of IoT in agriculture, including supply chain optimisation and resource management, as well as real-time soil monitoring and climate prediction. AI applications are revolutionising crop health assessment, pest and disease detection, and automated agricultural chores like harvesting and weeding all at the same time. We also delve into the field of livestock management, where AI and IoT guarantee the health and welfare of animals while optimising farm productivity overall. But these game-changing possibilities come with drawbacks as well, such as privacy issues, data security, and the requirement for large financial outlays. Additional levels of complexity are created by societal ramifications and ethical considerations, such as fair access to technology in rural areas. This offers case studies that demonstrate effective implementations and sheds light on the legislative and policy frameworks influencing the use of IoT and AI in agriculture. These technologies have a bright future in agriculture, as new developments and worldwide trends have the potential to improve sustainable farming methods even more. © 2025 Elite Publishing House.

	abstract = {Advancing successful treatments for carpal instabilities of the wrist are hindered due, in part, to limited preclinical animal models. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the forelimb of the Yucatan minipig (YP) as a potential preclinical animal model for the human wrist by quantifying carpal biomechanics in vitro in the intact and after two ligament transection conditions. Porcine wrist biomechanics (n = 12, 5M, 7F) were determined in 28 range of motion (ROM) directions, in pronation-supination, and in volar-dorsal translation using a six-axis robotic musculoskeletal simulator. Testing was implemented in three conditions – intact, and after sequential transection of the radial intermediate ligament (RIL) and the dorsal intercarpal ligament (DIC). Mixed models were employed to examine differences in direction and conditions among male and female specimens. The intact ROM envelope was elliptical in shape and oriented toward ulnar flexion with the largest ROM about 15° from the flexion–extension axis. Transection of RIL and DIC did not alter the ROM envelope orientation, however, subtle increases in ROM were observed in extension and radial deviation following transection of both RIL and DIC. Pronation in neutral was greater than supination in all three test conditions. Volar translation increased subtly in the RIL and DIC condition. This novel study investigated the multidirectional biomechanics of the YP forelimb. ROM in the general directions of extension, radial and ulnar deviation were less than in humans, while flexion was substantially larger. These specific ligament transections had minor effects on the biomechanics of the YP forelimb. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Struvite recovery shows significant potential for simultaneously recovering nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from swine wastewater but is challenged by the occurrence and transformation of antibiotic residuals. Electrochemically mediated struvite precipitation with sacrificial magnesium anode (EMSP-Mg) is promising due to its automation and chemical-free merits. However, the fate of antibiotics remains underexplored. We investigated the behavior of sulfadiazine (SD), an antibiotic frequently detected but less studied than others within the EMSP-Mg system. Significantly less SD (≤ 5%) was co-precipitated with recovered struvite in EMSP-Mg than conventional chemical struvite precipitation (CSP) processes (15.0 to 50.0%). The reduced SD accumulation in struvite recovered via EMSP was associated with increased pH and electric potential differences, which likely enhanced the electrostatic repulsion between SD and struvite. In contrast, the typical strategies used in enhancing P removal in the EMSP-Mg system, including increasing the Mg/P ratio or the Mg-release rates, have shown negligible effects on SD adsorption. Furthermore, typical coexisting ions (Ca2+, Cl−, and HCO3−) inhibited SD adsorption onto recovered products. These results provide new insights into the interactions between antibiotics and struvite within the EMSP-Mg system, enhancing our understanding of antibiotic migration pathways and aiding the development of novel EMSP processes for cleaner struvite recovery. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Livestock management is evolving into a new era, characterized by the analysis of vast quantities of data (Big Data) collected from both traditional breeding methods and new technologies such as sensors, automated monitoring system, and advanced analytics. Artificial intelligence (A-In), which refers to the capability of machines to mimic human intelligence, including subfields like machine learning and deep learning, is playing a pivotal role in this transformation. A wide array of A-In techniques, successfully employed in various industrial and scientific contexts, are now being integrated into mainstream livestock management practices. In the case of swine breeding, while traditional methods have yielded considerable success, the increasing amount of information requires the adoption of new technologies such as A-In to drive productivity, enhance animal welfare, and reduce environmental impact. Current findings suggest that these techniques have the potential to match or exceed the performance of traditional methods, often being more scalable in terms of efficiency and sustainability within the breeding industry. This review provides insights into the application of A-In in porcine breeding, from the perspectives of both sows (including welfare and reproductive management) and boars (including semen quality and health), and explores new approaches which are already being applied in other species. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Labor shortages in the United States are impacting a number of industries including the meat processing sector. Collaborative technologies that work alongside humans while increasing production abilities may support the industry by enhancing automation and improving job quality. However, existing automation technologies used in the meat industry have limited collaboration potential, low flexibility, and high cost. The objective of this work was to explore the use of a robot arm to collaboratively work alongside a human and complete tasks performed in a meat processing facility. Toward this objective, we demonstrated proof-of-concept approaches to ensure human safety while exploring the capacity of the robot arm to perform example meat processing tasks. In support of human safety, we developed a knife instrumentation system to detect when the cutting implement comes into contact with meat within the collaborative space. To demonstrate the capability of the system to flexibly conduct a variety of basic meat processing tasks, we developed vision and control protocols to execute slicing, trimming, and cubing of pork loins. We also collected a subjective evaluation of the actions from experts within the U.S. meat processing industry. On average the experts rated the robot’s performance as adequate. Moreover, the experts generally preferred the cuts performed in collaboration with a human worker to cuts completed autonomously, highlighting the benefits of robotic technologies that assist human workers rather than replace them.

The primary objective of this study is to explore artificial intelligence for food production among smallholder farmers in Nigeria in order to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the country. Content analysis and systematic literature review is used in this study. The findings of the study demonstrated that the application of artificial intelligence can contribute to realization of SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) with appropriate government interventions in the sector. In addition, it is also shown that artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for weeding, spraying pesticides, monitoring livestock, and automating harvesting processes. It is further noted that digitalization of agriculture through AI tools reduces middlemen, expands market opportunities, and enhances productivity and livelihoods of small-scale farmers. It is therefore suggested that the stakeholders in the agricultural sector should actively involve in training smallholder farmers in digital skills for efficient application of AI. © 2025, Creative Publishing House.

	abstract = {【Objective】Swine limb and hoof disease is one of the significant reasons for culling breeding swine, resulting in substantial economic losses for livestock farms. The diagnosis of swine limb and hoof disease typically relies on manual observation of pig gaits, which consumes high labor costs and has low efficiency. The aim of this study is to achieve automated pig gait scoring, and efficiently determine the health status of swine limb and hoof.【Method】This study proposed an “end-to-end” pig gait scoring method. Videos of individual breeding swine passing through designated channels were collected and a four-point gait dataset was created. Deep learning techniques were employed for video analysis. A time attention module (TAM) based on a 3D convolutional neural network was designed to effectively extract feature information between video frame images. By combining TAM with residual structures, the pig gait scoring model TA3D was constructed for feature extraction and gait classification scoring in the gait videos. To further improve model performance and achieve automation, the gait focus module (GFM) was designed. GFM could autonomously extract effective information from real-time video streams to synthesize high-quality gait videos, improving model performance while reducing computational costs. 【Result】The experimental results demonstrated that GFM could operate in real-time and reduced the size of gait videos by over 90%, significantly reducing storage cost, and the gait scoring accuracy of the TA3D model was 96.43%. Moreover, the comparison test results with other classic video analysis models showed that TA3D achieved optimal levels of accuracy and inference speed. 【Conclusion】This paper proposes a solution that can be applied to the automatic scoring of pig gait, providing a reference for the automatic detection of swine limb and hoof disease. © 2024 Editorial Department, Journal of South Agricultural University.

	abstract = {The detection of bacterial and viral microbes is pivotal for both human and animal well-being in public health services and veterinary care, but it traditionally requires time-consuming procedures and expert technicians. However, the rise of Machine Learning and Deep Learning has led to a surge in the application of new techniques that can perform bacterial and viral detection faster and at a lower cost. Yet, despite that success, Deep Learning approaches tend to have high energy demands, which can in some contexts limit their application, increasing both costs and environmental concerns. In this study, a new hybrid methodology, in which an Artificial Neural Network was combined with a more energy efficient Spiking Neural Network, was employed to develop a model able to classify 18 species of Eimeria parasites, affecting both rabbits and chickens, from microscope images. We show how significant energy savings can be obtained from SNN layers, while their use in the model can improve its performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {An exploratory survey (i) to investigate livestock production system, reproductive and production performance of Irob cattle and (ii) to recognize constraints to cattle production was conducted in eastern Tigray zone, northern Ethiopia. Six tabias (the smallest administrative unit consisting of several villages) were chosen using purposive sampling method and households from each tabia were randomly selected. Mixed crop-livestock farming system dominates the study area. Overall herd size was 5.3 ± 2.7, with each herd comprising of 1.7 ± 1.2 cows, 1.4 ± 0.9 oxen, 0.5 ± 0.7 heifers, 0.5 ± 0.7 bulls and 1.2 ± 0.9 calves. Cattle are kept for draught power (index = 0.43), milk (index = 0.32), income (index = 0.15), manure (index = 0.06) and crop threshing (index = 0.04). Major feed resources in the study area were natural pasture, crop residue and cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica). Overall mean (± SD) for age at first services (AFS), age at first calving (AFC), calving interval (CI), days open (DO), daily milk yield (DMY) and lactation length (LL) was 28.3 ± 3.9 months, 37.4 ± 5.5 months, 15.5 ± 4.1 months, 6.5 ± 1.8 months, 1.7 ± 0.4 L and 7.4 ± 2.0 months, respectively. There was no significant (p > 0.05) difference in performance traits between districts. Well-known cattle production constraints in order of significance were feed, disease and parasites, AI, water and veterinary service.

	abstract = {Background: Giardia duodenalis is an important intestinal parasitic protozoan that infects several vertebrates, including humans. Cattle are considered the major source of giardiasis outbreak in humans. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and multilocus genotype (MLG) of G. duodenalis in Shanxi, and lay the foundation for the prevention and control of Giardiosis. Methods and Results: DNA extraction, nested polymerase chain reaction, sequence analysis, MLG analysis, and statistical analysis were performed using 858 bovine fecal samples from Shanxi based on three gene loci: β-giardin (bg), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and triosephosphate isomerase (tpi). The overall prevalence of G. duodenalis was 28.3%, while its prevalence in Yingxian and Lingqiu was 28.1% and 28.5%, respectively. The overall prevalence of G. duodenalis in dairy cattle and beef cattle was 28.0% and 28.5%, respectively. G. duodenalis infection was detected in all age groups evaluated in this study. The overall prevalence of G. duodenalis in diarrhea and nondiarrhea samples was 32.4% and 27.5%, respectively, whereas that in intensively farmed and free-range cattle was 35.0% and 19.9%, respectively. We obtained 83, 53, and 59 sequences of bg, gdh, and tpi in G. duodenalis, respectively. Moreover, assemblage A (n = 2) and assemblage E (n = 81) by bg, assemblage A (n = 1) and assemblage E (n = 52) by gdh, and assemblage A (n = 2) and assemblage E (n = 57) by tpi were identified. Multilocus genotyping yielded 29 assemblage E MLGs, which formed 10 subgroups. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report cattle infected with G. duodenalis in Shanxi, China. Livestock-specific G. duodenalis assemblage E was the dominant assemblage genotype, and zoonotic sub-assemblage AI was also detected in this region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is one of the fundamental components of human civilization, contributing not only to food production but also to economic growth. Early identification of diseases in plants presents a significant challenge, as timely identification is crucial to increasing agricultural production. Incorporating the latest technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, in fields can reduce major losses for farmers and also improve productivity. In this paper, we have proposed a Deep Vision transformer and an Explainable AI (XAI)-based technique to address various diseases in plants. Here, we have used the dataset “Plant Village" as a case study that focuses on two majorly grown crops like: potatoes and tomatoes. In addition, we have analysed nine diseases that affect these crops around the world, with tomatoes showing six different conditions and potatoes affected by three bacterial diseases. The proposed DVTXAI framework incorporates the Deep vision transforms to identify plant diseases at an early stage. In the experiments, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 93.56% for tomatoes and 99.95% for potatoes. Additionally, to make model ‘Trustworthy’, we make model Explainable, which reveals the transparency mechanism that helps the farmer to make the right decision at an early stage of the crop. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Intelligent farming has been an ever-increasing trend in agricultural production, with the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT). Rapid and accurate identification of cattle identity is of great significance to prevent the insurance fraud for the live cattle loans in the cattle industry. Among them, computer vision can be expected for the cattle face recognition in the modernization transformation of the livestock industry. Smart devices and systems can also be integrated to achieve the intelligent cattle management, feeding, and disease prevention. However, the traditional identification (such as ear tags and collars) has limited the large-scale production in recent years, due to the small differences in facial features among different cattle, the deep layers of the FaceNet network, slow inference speeds, and insufficient classification accuracy. In this study, a cattle face recognition was proposed using FaceNet, called VanillaFaceNet. Firstly, the backbone feature extraction network of FaceNet was replaced with the latest simplified network. VanillaNet-13. Dynamic activation and enhanced linear transformation of activation functions were proposed to improve the non-linearity of the network. Specifically, dynamic activation was fully utilized the expressive power of activation functions during training when dynamically adjusting, in order to flexibly adapt the variations in data distribution at different stages of training. Dynamic activation was used to merge the convolutional layers during inference phase. The computational load was reduced to improve the inference speed of networks. The performance and efficiency of model were then enhanced during training and inference. Activation functions with linear transformations were significantly enhanced the non-linearity through parallel stacking. Multiple activation functions were stacked in parallel, thus enabling each layer to capture more complex features. Additionally, spatial context information was embedded within the activation functions. The spatial relationships among features were better utilized to fit the complex feature distributions. Non-linearity and integration of spatial context information were achieved in a more accurate and efficient model when processing complex data. Secondly, DBCA (Dual-Branch Coordinate Attention) module was added into the global maximum pooling. Global average pooling was used to aggregate significant features of cattle faces, in order better represent the differences among cattle facial features. Therefore, the accuracy network was improved to recognize the cattle. Finally, a center loss was introduced to train the network with the center-triplet loss joint supervision, because the triplet loss was only reduced the inter-class differences among cattle. The intra-class separability of cattle was improved to compactly aggregate the same category of cattle. Thus, the accuracy of comparisons was improved among the same identities of cattle. Cattle face videos were collected at the Otai Ranch in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. An image dataset was constructed to train and test the model for the cattle face recognition. The experimental results show that VanillaFaceNet was achieved an accuracy of 88.21% in the cattle recognition, with a frame rate of 26.23 frames per second (FPS). Compared with FaceNet, MobileFaceNet, CenterFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, the model was improved the recognition accuracy by 2.99, 9.58, 6.26, 3.85, and 4.49 percentage points, respectively, and the inference speed by 2.67, 0.77, 0.10, 1.28, and 0.94 frames/s, respectively. The recognition accuracy and speed were greatly improved to fully meet the requirements of the ranch for the accuracy and real-time performance of cattle recognition. The excellent performance was achieved in the cattle recognition, suitable for the deployment on embedded devices, such as Jetson AGX Xavier. A better balance was also gained between accuracy and inference speed of cattle facial recognition. © 2024 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Coccidiosis is a gastrointestinal parasitic disease caused by different species of Eimeria and Isospora, poses a significant threat to pig farming, leading to substantial economic losses attributed to reduced growth rates, poor feed conversion, increased mortality rates, and the expense of treatment. Traditional methods for identifying Coccidia species in pigs rely on fecal examination and microscopic analysis, necessitating expert personnel for accurate species identification. To address this need, a deep learning-based mobile application capable of automatically identifying different species of Eimeria and Isospora was developed. The present study focused on six species, namely, E. debliecki, E. perminuta, E. porci, E. spinosa, E. suis, and Isospora suis, commonly found in pigs of the North Eastern Hill (NEH) region of India. Utilizing a two-stage approach, segmentation of coccidia oocysts in microscopic images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), followed by species identification by same network was carried out in this work. Resource-efficient models, including EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB1, MobileNet, and MobileNetV2, within an encoder-decoder architecture were utilized to extract features. Transfer learning was applied to enhance model accuracy during training. Additionally, a marker-controlled watershed algorithm was implemented to separate touching cells, thus reducing misclassification. The results demonstrate that all the developed models effectively segmented/classified Coccidia species, achieving mean Intersection-over-Union (m-IoU) values exceeding 0.92, with individual class IoU scores above 0.90. MobileNetV2 exhibited the highest m-IoU of 0.95, followed by EfficientNetB1 with an m-IoU of 0.94. For classification, MobileNetV2 demonstrated the highest performance, with accuracy, precision, and recall values of 0.93, 0.96, and 0.96, respectively. EfficientNetB1 yielded an accuracy of 0.91. The developed mobile application, tested on new data, achieved an identification accuracy of 91.0 %. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning-based mobile applications in effectively identifying Coccidia species in pigs, thus, providing a promising solution to mitigate reliance on expert personnel and laborious time-consuming experiments in this domain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The future of reproductive biotechnologies in water buffalo in Southeast Asian countries holds significant promise for enhancing genetic quality and productivity. Fixed-time artificial insemination remains the commonly used technology, with advances in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro embryo production (IVEP), embryo transfer (ET), and the use of sex-sorted sperm increasingly adopted to improve breeding efficiency. These technologies overcome traditional breeding limitations, such as low reproductive rates, genetic diversity constraints, and the production of sex-predetermined offspring. The application of multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) is constrained by poor embryo recovery in this livestock species. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) offers great potential for producing sex-predetermined and genetically superior buffalo but requires further research to increase efficiency. Cryopreservation of buffalo genetics is bolstered by the establishment of Gene Banks. Challenges such as high costs, the need for skilled personnel, and infrastructure development remain constraints. Integration of genomic selection, automation, and expansion of ET programs are clear directions. Strengthening research and collaboration among Southeast Asian countries is essential to fully realize the benefits of these biotechnologies and ensure sustainable and profitable buffalo farming. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {From a specific need of the national institution responsible for plant and animal health in Argentina, SENASA, this collaborative work between the public sectors together with academia arises. The objective was the development of a Deep Learning algorithm for the detection of livestock, cows in particular, in very high-resolution satellite images (provided by the Argentine Space Agency (CONAE)) and its subsequent counting. The basic elements involved in the development of artificial intelligence are detailed, such as the selection and acquisition of satellite images, their very thorough preprocessing and labelling, details of the training stage and some forms of error quantification. The image database is made up of about 320 scenes (based on very high resolution (VHR) satellite data from the Pleiades and Pleiades NEO sensors, ©Airbus 2022, distributed by CONAE) of the Pampas and Patagonian regions in Argentina. Around 8,000 labels of different types of animals were generated, the most common were cows and sheep. Also labels that did not represent animals to contribute to training. Finally, some very promising preliminary results are presented, such as the average error in the count that was achieved was +/-four cows. The usefulness of these tools is reflected in better management of renewable natural resources linked to animal health issues, fiscal issues and within the framework of the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals #12, #15 and #17. © Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Automation is critically important for sustainability in meat production, where heavy reliance on human labour is a growing challenge. In this work, a novel robotic Meat Factory Cell (MFC) platform presents the opportunity for unconventional automation in pork meat processing, particularly abattoirs. Instead of following line-based approaches, which are the main option today, it uses robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to perform complex cutting and manipulation operations on entire unchilled pork carcasses, with awareness of biological variation and deformation. The long-term goal of the MFC is to take a pork carcass as an input and produce seven primal outputs: hams, shoulders, saddle, belly and entire organ set. However, the MFC platform is under continuous development – therefore, this paper aims to demonstrate it through a specific use-case: shoulder removal. The system is evaluated based on data from testing and development sessions (June–November 2022), with a total of 34 attempted shoulder removals. Data regarding the MFCs’ ability to handle variation, in addition to success rate and process timing models are presented. Qualitative feedback from skilled butchers is also discussed. The authors propose that, as well as technical development of the platform, it is important to consider new ways of comparing unconventional systems with their conventional counterparts. Innovative manufacturing systems have more to offer than raw speed and volume; traits such as flexibility, robustness and scalability – particularly economic scalability – should play a prominent role. Future legislation and standards must also encourage innovation rather than hinder innovative robotics solutions. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Using deep learning for AI-based vision adapted from industrial applications and human behavioral analysis, the framework includes modules for markerless animal identification and health status assessment (e.g., locomotion score and body condition score). Methods for behavioral analysis are also included to evaluate how nutritional and rearing conditions impact behaviors. These models are initially trained on public datasets and then fine-tuned on original data. We demonstrate the approach through two use cases: a health monitoring system for dairy cattle and a piglet behavior analysis system.

This study presents a model for assessing PA adoption in organic farming within the Visegrad Group countries: Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia using a survey-based approach. Key technologies examined include drones, sensors, and robots used in organic crop and livestock production. Findings indicate that the Czech Republic leads in drone usage for soil monitoring (70 %), Hungary excels in soil moisture sensors (55 %), Slovakia prioritizes drones for fertilizer application (75 %), and Poland shows significant use of robots for harvesting and seed planting (33 %). This model effectively highlights cross-country differences in PA technology adoption and associated environmental outcomes, addressing a gap in understanding PA use in organic farming in Visegrad group countries. The results of the study provide actionable insights for improving the adoption of Precision Agriculture technologies in organic farming across the selected countries. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders promoting sustainable agricultural innovation.

	abstract = {Background: Bangladesh has a rich heritage of livestock rearing. The management and breeding practices differ across the country. Objectives: To study the present scenario of breeding and management practices of livestock at northern Teesta river basin based Lalmonirhat district in Bangladesh. Methodology: Total 100 farmers were selected using random sampling technique from 5 upazilas of Lalmonirhat district during July to December, 2022. Data were analyzed using SPSS 23.0 statistical package. Results: Results showed that most of the farmers (65%) at the northern part of Bangladesh were middle-aged, 41% of them completed secondary education, and their occupation was mainly agriculture (55%). About 37.78% of respondents supplied roadside grass as roughage to their livestock. Maximum number of respondents (60.24%) supplied hand mixed feed as a source of concentrate whereas 39.76% of respondents used commercial feed. 96% of farmers practiced artificial insemination to inseminate their cows and heifers while in goat nearly all respondent farmers (98.41%) practiced natural mating. Among the breeding companies, 41.41% farmers preferred semen from the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), followed by Advanced Chemical Industries (ACI) (30.30%), Government (Department of Livestock Services (DLS) (22.22%), and others (6.07%). About 41.76% respondents used 50% Sahiwal - 50% local genotype bull to breed the cows whereas 23.08% respondents used 100% Sahiwal, 18.68% used 75% Holstein Friesian-25% local, 5.49% used 100% Holstein Friesian, 3.30% used 50% Holstein Friesian-50% Local and only 3.30% used 87.5% Holstein Friesian-12.5% Local genotype bull semen, respectively. On the other hand, most of the farmers (98.41%) chosen Black Bengal breeding buck during breeding and remaining used crossbred (Black Bengal Goat- Jamunapari) to breed their does. The actual price of bull semen from Govt. (DLS) was 30 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) on average for all the breeds whereas, the price ranged 110-200 BDT depending on cattle breeds and bull/bucks Identification (ID) in different private enterprises. Farmers had to pay on an average 181.18 BDT for DLS originated semen in addition to that BRAC Artificial Insemination (AI) workers took an average of 425.61 BDT from farmers to inseminate their cows. The average milk yield/d was 1.82±0.14, 3.35±0.40, and 2.74±0.27 liters for local, HF crossbred and Sahiwal crossbred respectively in that region. The prevalence of repeat breeding incidences was 13.74%, 14.21%, and 15.17%, for Local, Sahiwal crossbred, and Holstein Friesian crossbred genotypes respectively. The highest incidence of disease was found as Lumpy Skin Disease (14.67%) followed by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) (11.98%) and other parasitic and metabolic diseases. In the study area, it was found that maximum number of the respondents (95%) faced excessive feed price problem along with some other problems. Implications: Government intervention is necessary to improve the situation of livestock production in the country.

	abstract = {Goat production plays an important role in the economy of developing countries. The rise in the demand for meat protein has led to an increase in the productivity of livestock, especially small ruminants. The reproductive system of a doe consists of a pair of ovaries (reproductive glands), tubular genital organs (uterus, uterine tubes, vagina, vestibule), and external genital organs (vulva, clitoris, urethra). Modern reproductive technologies have created a variety of new opportunities for research, treatment, and manipulation of the reproductive process both in vitro and in vivo, with the goal of enhancing reproductive efficiency in a variety of domestic livestocks. The goat is an excellent candidate for applied reproductive technology because of its overall hardiness, high fecundity, good mothering capacity, and extended breeding season. The commonly employed assisted reproductive techniques include artificial insemination (AI), synchronization, and superovulation or multiple ovulation and embryo transfer, cloning, transgenesis and embryo and sperm sexing. These technologies can be exploited to improve the reproductive efficiency and productivity of goats to meet the increasing demand for meat protein. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to assess whether early intervention with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) following a disease alert generated by automated milk feeders could reduce diarrhea severity and improve performance in dairy calves. A total of 71 Holstein calves were enrolled on an automated milk feeder (recorded milk intake and drinking speed) at 3 d of age and received up to 15 L/d (150 g/L) of milk replacer until 35 d of age. An alert that was previously validated as diagnostically accurate to identify calves at risk for diarrhea was used using automated milk feeder data (≤60% rolling dividends in milk intake or drinking speed over 2 d). At their first alert, calves were randomly allocated to receive a single subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim) at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg of BW (NSAID) or an equal volume of saline as a placebo control (CON). Fecal consistency was scored daily, and calves were diagnosed with diarrhea when they had loose feces for ≥2 d or watery feces for ≥1 d. Body weight was recorded at birth and weekly thereafter. A subset of calves (n = 32) were fitted with IceQube pedometers at 3 d of age to measure activity behaviors (lying time and step count). Mixed linear regression models were used to assess the association of study treatment with the duration of diarrhea after the alert and to evaluate the association of study treatment with milk intake, drinking speed, lying time, overall activity for 5 d following the alert, and ADG for 3 wk following the alert. On average, calves triggered an alert at (mean ± SD) 9.3 ± 2.3 d of age and were diagnosed with diarrhea at 9.6 ± 2.1 d of age. Diarrhea duration was similar between treatments (NSAID: 2.85 vs. CON: 2.94 ± 0.37 d), as were feeding behaviors (milk intake [NSAID: 8.2 vs. CON: 8.1 ± 0.4 L/d] and drinking speed [NSAID: 0.38 vs. CON: 0.37 ± 0.02 min/L]). Treatment was also not associated with ADG for the 3 wk after the alert (NSAID: 0.97 vs. CON: 0.97 ± 0.06 kg/d). However, calves provided an NSAID had reduced odds of being treated with electrolytes (odds ratio = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.10–0.98). In addition, calves provided an NSAID spent less time lying (NSAID: 17.64 vs. CON: 18.17 ± 0.19 h/day) and performed more steps over the 5 d following the alert (NSAID: 789.1 vs. CON: 628.0 steps/d), suggesting that CON calves may have been more lethargic. Overall, providing an NSAID at the time of a diarrhea alert did not affect diarrhea duration, feed intake, or growth. However, providing an NSAID increased activity in the 5 d following the alert, which may have reduced pain and symptoms of lethargy, indicating a milder response to the disease. We suggest that providing an NSAID at the time of diarrhea alert had little benefit on the calf; however, further work is needed to understand behaviors associated with malaise and pain in calves with diarrhea as well as the efficacy of NSAID under different management conditions. © 2025 American Dairy Science Association},

	abstract = {Computer vision, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), is increasingly being applied in various industries, including livestock farming. Identifying and managing livestock through machine learning is essential to improve efficiency and animal welfare. The aim of this work is to automatically identify individual sheep or goats based on their physical characteristics including muzzle pattern, coat pattern, or ear pattern. The proposed intelligent classifier was built on the Roboflow platform using the YOLOv8 model, trained with 35,204 images. Initially, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed, but its performance was not optimal. The pre-trained VGG16 model was then adapted, and additional fine-tuning was performed using data augmentation techniques. The dataset was split into training (88%), validation (8%), and test (4%) sets. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-Score metrics, with comparisons against other pre-trained models such as EfficientNet. The YOLOv8 classifier achieved 95.8% accuracy in distinguishing between goat and sheep images. Compared to the CNN and VGG16 models, the YOLOv8-based classifier showed superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The results confirm that deep learning models, particularly YOLOv8, significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of livestock identification and management. Future research could extend this technology to other livestock species and explore real-time monitoring through IoT integration. © 2024 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Graphene oxide (GO) has been extensively studied for its diverse biomedical applications, including drug delivery, imaging, and tissue engineering. Silymarin, as a flavonoid complex derived from the milk thistle plant, has recently shown potential health benefits, particularly concerning reproductive health. This study aims to evaluate the effects of GO and silymarin supplementation, both individually and in combination, on the characteristics of frozen-thawed ram sperm. Semen samples were collected using standard artificial insemination (AI) techniques with an artificial vagina. The collected semen was evaluated and cryopreserved in a tris-based extender containing varying concentrations of silymarin and GO (0, 10, or 20 μg/mL) or their combination. Post-thaw assessments evaluated sperm motility, viability, morphological abnormalities, DNA integrity, membrane integrity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Our findings revealed that the combination of 20 μg/mL silymarin and 20 μg/mL GO significantly enhanced total motility, viability, membrane integrity, and DNA integrity of sperm. Additionally, this treatment effectively reduced morphological abnormalities and MDA levels post-thawing. Notably, SOD and TAC activities were improved following the freeze-thaw compared to other treatment groups. In conclusion, the combination of silymarin and GO significantly improves the quality of frozen-thawed ram sperm by enhancing sperm parameters while reducing oxidative stress markers. The results suggest their potential as effective additives in cryopreservation protocols, providing a promising avenue for improving reproductive outcomes in rams and potentially other livestock species. © 2025},

Traditional meat production is known for its high energy consumption and significant carbon emissions, necessitating alternative approaches. Plant-based meat (PBM) offers a promising solution to reduce the ecological footprint of animal agriculture. This paper examines various challenges in PBM development, including nutritional equivalence, industrial scalability, organoleptic properties, and digestibility. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure consumer acceptance, regulatory compliance, and environmental stewardship. Advanced technologies like nanotechnology, fermentation, and enzymatic hydrolysis, along with automation and repurposing cattle farms, offer solutions to enhance PBM’s quality and production efficiency.

	abstract = {Animal welfare has become a critical issue in contemporary society, emphasizing our ethical responsibilities toward animals, particularly within livestock farming. In addition, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, specifically computer vision, offers a innovative approach to monitoring and enhancing animal welfare. Cows, as essential contributors to sustainable agriculture and climate management, being a central part of it. However, existing cow detection algorithms face significant challenges in real-world farming environments, such as complex lighting, occlusions, pose variations and background interference, which hinder accurate and reliable detection. Additionally, the model generalization power is highly desirable as it enables the model to adapt and perform well across different contexts and conditions, beyond its training environment or dataset. This study addresses these challenges in diverse cow dataset composed of six different environments, including indoor and outdoor scenarios. More precisely, we propose a novel detection model that combines YOLOv8 with the CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) and assess its performance against baseline models, including Mask R-CNN, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8. Our findings indicate that while baseline models show promise, their performance degrades in complex real-world conditions, which our approach improves using the CBAM attention module. Overall, YOLOv8-CBAM outperformed YOLOv8 by 2.3% in mAP across all camera types, achieving a precision of 95.2% and an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 82.6%, demonstrating superior generalization and enhanced detection accuracy in complex backgrounds. Thus, the primary contributions of this research are: (1) providing an in-depth analysis of current limitations in cow detection under challenging indoor and outdoor environments, (2) proposing a robust general model that effectively detects cows in complex real-world conditions and (3) evaluating and benchmarking state-of-the-art detection algorithms. Potential application scenarios of the model include automated health monitoring, behavioral analysis and tracking within smart farm management systems, enabling precise detection of individual cows, even in challenging environments. By addressing these critical challenges, this study paves the way for future innovations in AI-driven livestock monitoring, aiming to improve the welfare and management of farm animals while advancing smart agriculture. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In the domain of egg production, the application of automation technologies is essential for boosting productivity and quality. This study introduces an online monitoring system designed for egg quality assessment within caged environments, incorporating a robotic patrol system for egg localization and a fixed video stream for quality analysis. The project involved upgrading traditional henhouses with enhanced wireless connectivity and developing data transmission techniques for video streams and image data. The core of the system, an enhanced You Only Look Once Version 8-small (YOLOv8s) model, was augmented by substituting the Residual Network-18 backbone and integrating the Shuffle Attention mechanism, significantly improving egg detection precision. This refined model was implemented on Jetson AGX Orin industrial computer to facilitate real-world applications. To diverse operational needs, two distinct post-processing algorithms were developed: one for counting eggs and detecting abnormalities during robotic patrols, and another for assessing egg quality through fixed video streams, which measured crucial parameters such as egg dimensions and shape indexes. Experimental results revealed that the henhouse average network latencies of 35 ms, with signal strengths between -30 and -71 dBm, ensuring data transmission to the poultry management system. The enhanced YOLOv8s model, deployed on the Jetson AGX Orin, demonstrated well improvements: a Precision of 94.0 % (+2.4 %), Recall rate of 92.8 % (+4.6 %), Average Precision50:95 of 91.5 % (+3 %) and F1 score of 93.4 % (+3.9 %), with a minor decrease in detection speed to 91.7 Frame Per Second (-18.2). Field experiment in 60 chicken cages during robotic patrols achieved an egg recognition rate of 98.9 %, validating the system's effectiveness. In fixed settings, an 83-minute experiment managed to analyze egg numbers and abnormalities, attaining a 100 % recognition rate with all scoring data promptly relayed back to the management system. Overall, this research introduces a comprehensive system for monitoring egg production and quality in cage environments, addressing manual recording and quality assessment challenges in caged poultry farming.

	abstract = {Phenotyping of animals is a routine task in agriculture which can provide large datasets for the functional annotation of genomes. Using the livestock farming sector to study complex traits enables genetics researchers to fully benefit from the digital transformation of society as economies of scale substantially reduces the cost of phenotyping animals on farms. In the agricultural sector genomics has transitioned towards a model of 'Genomics without the genes' as a large proportion of the genetic variation in animals can be modelled using the infinitesimal model for genomic breeding valuations. Combined with third generation sequencing creating pan-genomes for livestock the digital infrastructure for trait collection and precision farming provides a unique opportunity for high-throughput phenotyping and the study of complex traits in a controlled environment. The emphasis on cost efficient data collection mean that mobile phones and computers have become ubiquitous for cost-efficient large-scale data collection but that the majority of the recorded traits can still be recorded manually with limited training or tools. This is especially valuable in low- and middle income countries and in settings where indigenous breeds are kept at farms preserving more traditional farming methods. Digitalization is therefore an important enabler for high-throughput phenotyping for smaller livestock herds with limited technology investments as well as large-scale commercial operations. It is demanding and challenging for individual researchers to keep up with the opportunities created by the rapid advances in digitalization for livestock farming and how it can be used by researchers with or without a specialization in livestock. This review provides an overview of the current status of key enabling technologies for precision livestock farming applicable for the functional annotation of genomes.  © 2024 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {With the application of facility-based agriculture, robotics, and other technologies in agricultural production, the accurate recognition of individual crop phenological stages has become crucial for precision agriculture. However, the slightly noticeable visual disparities between neighboring phenological stages of crops pose a challenge for fine-grained phenological classification based on image features. Phenotypic features of plants, providing a wealth of information about crop-growth patterns, exhibit remarkable similarity within the same phenological stage. This paper presents a framework named PhenologyNet, which leverages the significant role of phenotypic features for fine-grained crop-phenology classification. A novel phenology-classification model was developed by leveraging local crop phenotypic features, assigning dynamic weights based on a phenology-specific matrix. The model calculates overall similarity from nine patch pair similarities, capturing the nuanced importance of local features during different phenological stages. This was combined with the phenology classification based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a late fusion approach, achieving precise fine-grained recognition of crop phenological stages. PhenologyNet was trained and tested on a lettuce-phenology dataset classified according to 28 “Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und Chemische Industrie” (BBCH) phenological stages, achieving an accuracy of 92.79%. Comparative experiments with other methodologies excluding phenotypic similarity showed that the incorporation of phenotypic similarity notably enhanced the efficiency of the fine-grained crop-phenology classification. PhenologyNet's performance further improved when the number of BBCH phenological stages decreased, suggesting the framework's commendable capabilities in tackling the issue of crop-phenology classification in a way that meets precision agriculture's requirements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Given increasing global political, security and economic challenges, politicians in the European Union (EU) are seeking to reduce the EU’s dependence on imports, including feed for farmed livestock. While insect farming has been suggested as an advantageous source of livestock feed is the insect farming industry, the sector has not met optimistic expectations. In particular, labor and electricity costs are driving insect companies offshore, including to Asia and the United States. This paper explores ways that the EU could solve this problem, the most promising of which is to expand the EU’s production of maize and soy. Technical summary. In the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and increasing global destabilization, policy makers within the European Union have expressed the need to reduce the bloc’s dependence on imported agricultural products such as livestock feed. One industry that has been promoted as an advantageous source of livestock feed is insect agriculture. However, the insect industry’s growth has not kept pace with optimistic expectations, and high labor and electricity costs in Europe appear to be driving major insect companies to expand production offshore. One solution may involve supporting the automation of insect farming, though automation may have harmful social consequences by reducing employment and exacerbating inequality. A more promising solution could involve bringing additional land under cultivation to expand domestic production of maize and soy, and the most up-to-date estimates suggest that doing so may even offer environmental benefits over insect production.

Motility-based protein markers, proAKAP4, as one of the molecular markers that have recently been developed in the breeding industry, are expected to be applied and used at AI centers in Indonesia to optimize the use of superior Bali bulls, which are also supported by various semen and freezability characteristics. Using all Bali bulls from the Regional AI center in one of the provinces in Indonesia, this study divided the bulls into motility grade A and motility grade B groups. The collected semen is tested using various methods based on the literature, including fresh and frozen semen and sperm freezability. The proAKAP4 was quantified using the Bull 4MID® Kit with ELISA. The characteristics of fresh semen were significantly different (P < 0.05) except for sperm abnormalities (P > 0.05). The frozen semen characteristics were significantly different (P < 0.05) regarding plasma membrane integrity, DNA fragmentation, and several kinematic parameters. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the freezability characteristics of Bali bull sperm. ProAKAP4 was significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant in the motility grade B bull group and was closely correlated (P < 0.05) with progressive motility and sperm viability. Motility-based protein markers, proAKAP4, can be applied to bulls at the Regional AI Center, with quantification results showing that half of the bull population used in research does not meet the fitness standards for superior bulls. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI), as an efficient assisted reproduction technology, can help the livestock industry to improve livestock and poultry breeds, optimize production performance and improve reproductive efficiency. AI technology has been widely used in pig production in China, but boar fertility affects the effectiveness of AI, and more and more studies have shown that there are significant differences in the fertility of boars with similar semen quality indicators. Therefore, this study aimed to identify biomarker molecules that indicate the level of boar fertility, which is important for improving the efficiency of AI. In this study, we collected 40 mL of ejaculates per boar used for extracellular vesicle (EV) characterization in 20 boars and identified 53 differentially expressed miRNAs by small RNA sequencing, of which 44 miRNAs were up-regulated in the high-fertility seminal EVs compared with low-fertility seminal EVs, and nine miRNAs were down-regulated. miR-26a was most significantly down-regulated in the high-fertility group compared to the low-fertility group, and it was hypothesized that this miRNA could be used as a biomolecular marker of semen reproductive performance. To further determine the effect of miR-26a on sperm function, we successfully established a miR-26a overexpression model and found that miR-26a reduced sperm viability, motility, acrosome integrity, plasma membrane integrity and ATP levels. Bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter analysis revealed that miR-26a directly targets High mobility group A1 (HMGA1). In conclusion, miR-26a can be used as a biomarker to identify high and low fertility in boar semen. © 2024 by the authors.},

Computer vision (CV) is indispensable in PLF by using cameras and computer algorithms to supplement or supersede manual efforts for livestock data acquisition. Data availability is crucial for developing innovative monitoring and analysis systems through artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques. However, data curation processes are tedious, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, impeding algorihtm development and evaluaiton. This study presents the first systematic survey of publicly available CV datasets of livestock species (https://github.com/Anil-Bhujel/Public-Computer-Vision-Dataset-A-Systematic-Survey). Among 67 public datasets identified from 65 published papers and analyzed, encompassing different species of livestock, almost half of them are for cattle, followed by swine, poultry, and other animals. Animal detection and color imaging are the dominant applications and imaging modality, respectively, in the public livestock dataset. The characteristics and baseline applications of the datasets are discussed, emphasizing the implications for animal welfare advocates. The current trend and future direction of imaging technology and CV datasets have been presented, inspiring stakeholders to share resources (ideas, data, and findings) to fill the gap between the rapid development of CV algorithms and data scarcity. Further, challenges and opportunities are discussed to inspire further efforts in developing livestock CV datasets and exploiting emerging algorithms in dataset curation and modeling. This survey highlights that the limited quantity of high-quality annotated datasets collected from diverse environments, animals, and applications, and the absence of contextual metadata, are a real bottleneck in PLF. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI) is a technology that has been widely used as a way to genetically improve the quality of livestock. One of the things that supports the successful implementation of IB is skill inseminator. If the inseminator services have to be paid for by the breeders, the willingness to pay will vary. Willingness to Pay (WTP) is the willingness to pay by service users for an imbalance of goods or services enjoyed, including inseminator services. The purpose of this study was to determine the WTP of beef cattle breeders for inseminator services that perform artificial insemination. The method of expressing preferences is a method used to determine the WTP of breeders for inseminator services. The results showed that 49 respondents (98%) of WTP farmers were included in the medium category, which ranged from 100,000 to 150,000 rupiah, while the other 2% were included in the high category with WTP values ranging from 151,000 to 200,000 rupiah. The average willingness to pay for respondents is IDR 112,000, the lowest is IDR 100,000 and the highest is IDR 200,000. This shows that the willingness to pay farmers for AI services is quite high. Farmers are willing to pay for artificial insemination because they feel the benefits they get when their livestock are included in the AI program. The performance of cattle produced from the AI program is better because the cattle produced are Limousin cattle with large body weights so that they can help increase farmer income. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI) plays a critical role in livestock reproduction, with semen quality being essential. In swine, AI primarily uses cool-stored semen adhering to industry standards assessed through routine analysis, yet fertility inconsistencies highlight the need for enhanced semen evaluation. Over 10-day storage at 17 °C, boar semen samples were analyzed for motility, morphology, sperm membrane integrity, apoptosis, and oxidative stress indicators. Additionally, machine learning tools were employed to explore the potential of Raman and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy in enhancing semen sample evaluation. Sperm motility and morphology gradually decreased during storage, with distinct groups categorized as “Good” or “Poor” survival semen according to motility on Day 7 of storage. Initially similar on Day 0 of semen collection, “Poor” samples revealed significantly lower total motility (21.69 ± 4.64% vs. 80.19 ± 1.42%), progressive motility (4.74 ± 1.71% vs. 39.73 ± 2.57%), and normal morphology (66.43 ± 2.60% vs. 87.91 ± 1.92%) than their “Good” counterparts by Day 7, using a computer-assisted sperm analyzer. Furthermore, “Poor” samples had higher levels of apoptotic cells, membrane damage, and intracellular reactive oxygen species on Day 0. Conversely, “Good” samples maintained higher total antioxidant capacity. Raman spectroscopy outperformed NIR, providing distinctive spectral profiles aligned with semen biochemical changes and enabling the prediction of semen survival during storage. Overall, the spectral profiles coupled with machine learning tools might assist in enhancing semen evaluation and prognosis. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Prior to the introduction of technological advances in agriculture, a farmer’s chances of producing quality crops were about equal to flicking a coin and hoping for heads. Smart farming uses new technologies that emerged at the start of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the fields of agriculture and animal husbandry, precision farming aims to boost production quantity and quality while maximizing resource efficiency and reducing the negative environmental effects. A further benefit of using technology in agricultural and livestock production is that it will contribute to the worldwide availability of food. Traditional farming methods are regional in nature. There is a standard set of crops that are grown everywhere. Regarding the sowing, nourishing, watering, and harvesting periods, every farmer in that region uses the same practice. These behaviors lead to unpredictable outcomes and excessive resource utilization. There was no way for farmers to determine the reason for crop loss because they lacked information on the land they owned. The farmers were forced into debt and losses by this practice. Farming innovations increased the sector’s glee, addressing the problem of uncertainty. An example of artificial intelligence (AI) in use is virtual reality (VR). It exemplifies the use of computer technology. It aids in producing an artificial environment that is a replica of the actual environment and is comparable to it. The application of augmented reality (AR) to farming will increase farm output. Agriculture will undergo a technological revolution as a result of AR. In the coming decades, the human population will grow steadily. As a result, AR will become more significant in agriculture. © 2025 Scrivener Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {The future of farming and farmers in India is smart farming, which uses intelligence to integrate information technology and communication tools equipped with sensors and actuators for embedded farm management. This involves using emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain to employ robots, drones, and artificial intelligence in the agricultural sector, which is modifying traditional farming practices and simultaneously posing a variety of difficulties. The aim is to explore the various tools and equipment used. Pesticides are an essential material used in agricultural land to eliminate insects or other harmful organisms that affect crop yields. However, excessive use of pesticides can result in problems such as decreased soil fertility and an increase in insect species' immunity. To overcome these challenges, a land-specific variable-rate spraying and directional spraying method can be employed, which offers an accurate and flexible alternative strategy. Soil moisture is a crucial parameter in agriculture as it affects plant growth and survival. Various factors like air content, salinity, toxic substances, soil structure, temperature, and heat capacity of the ground can affect soil moisture. Agriculture resource management can be enhanced by designing various technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain by using IoT sensors, drones and satellites, AI-powered cameras, weather stations, crop yield predictions, disease and pest detection, crop optimization, supply chain transparency, resource optimization, online communities, and data sharing networks. AI optimizes resource allocation and predicts outcomes. IoT provides real-time data for precision farming and livestock monitoring, while blockchain ensures transparency and security in supply chains and transactions, revolutionizing agricultural resource management. Agriculture resource management using technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain comes with ample potential results like increasing efficiency in agricultural operations, enhancing productivity, improving crop and livestock health, and facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration. © 2024 Bentham Science Publishers.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications related to agriculture have recently gained in use and attention. They are indeed valuable tools for interpreting data, improving production chains, and optimizing the use of natural resources. Among AI models, the most recent and promising area is represented by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI). After an initial description of its general model architectures, this work aims to review its practical uses and potentials in the following individual sectors: agriculture, precision farming, and animal farming, as well as interdisciplinary applications. The literature search was carried out using the SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. GAI holds immense potential for revolutionizing agriculture, offering solutions ranging from precision farming to pest management and supply chain optimization. Though some applications can extend beyond efficiency gains, and hallucinations occurrence i.e. false output information presented as fact, remains an open issue, GAI can be decisive for tasks like improving training datasets, refining models, and facilitating time series analysis. This review extensively describes the vital importance of these tasks for agriculture, precision and animal farming, caused by the rise of new technologies. As a result, by embracing and responsibly implementing GAI applications, it is possible to create a more sustainable and resilient future for agriculture and precision farming. GAI have the capacity to extract specific information from big data systems, offering huge potential to meet a growing global population demand and consequent environmental challenges for the future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the nutritional potential of two cultivated snail species, Acusta despecta and Achatina fulica, sourced from commercial farms in Korea, marking the first comprehensive analysis of A. despecta. The protein content of A. despecta (70.9 g/100 g dry matter) was significantly higher than that of A. fulica (44.2 g/100 g dry matter). Similar trends were observed for ash content (6.3 vs. 4.9 g/100 g dry matter) and crude fiber (2.9 vs. 0.4 g/100 g dry matter). Reflecting the higher protein content, A. despecta contained elevated levels of most amino acids compared to A. fulica. Glutamic acid was the most abundant amino acid, with leucine and lysine being the predominant essential amino acids in both species. The total amino acid content was 57.6 g/100 g dry matter for A. despecta and 40.4 g/100 g for A. fulica. Mineral analysis revealed significantly higher concentrations of minerals in A. despecta, except calcium and magnesium. Notably, A. despecta provided over 100% of the RDA/AI for calcium, phosphorus, copper, and manganese and met 94.5% of the iron RDA for women. These results emphasize the potential of A. despecta as a valuable dietary source for addressing protein and mineral deficiencies, particularly in nutrient-poor diets. © 2025 by the authors.},

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep learning (DL) have demonstrated their strong abilities in various areas, including language, vision, remote sensing (RS), and agrifood systems applications. However, the overall impact of AI on agrifood systems remains unclear. In this article, we thoroughly review how AI techniques can transform agrifood systems and contribute to the modern agrifood industry. First, we summarize the data acquisition methods in agrifood systems, including acquisition, storage, and processing techniques. Second, we present a progress review of AI methods in agrifood systems, specifically in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishery, covering topics such as agrifood classification, growth monitoring, yield prediction, and quality assessment. Furthermore, we highlight potential challenges and promising research opportunities for transforming modern agrifood systems with AI. We hope this survey can offer an overall picture to newcomers in the field and serve as a starting point for their further research.

In mixed biofilms, the AI-2 activity, reactive oxygen species levels and superoxide dismutase activity were significantly increased (P < 0.05). The upregulated expression of luxS and ahpC (P < 0.05) indicated that the L. plantarum biofilm significantly enhanced quorum sensing and reactive oxygen species levels in the C. perfringens biofilm cells. Moreover, L. plantarum R2 biofilms can downregulate the spo0A gene, resulting in a reduction in biofilm formation of C. perfringens (P < 0.05).

	abstract = {Background/Objectives: The use of antibiotics in livestock contributes to antimicrobial resistance, highlighting the need for alternative solutions. Among these, chelating agents, like ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and Chitosan, have shown potential in reducing bacterial contamination in seminal doses used in artificial insemination (AI), while preserving sperm quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential use of EDTA and Chitosan as alternatives to antibiotics for the liquid storage of rabbit seminal AI doses. Methods: EDTA (20 mM) and Chitosan (0.05%) were tested both individually and in combination, by adding them to the semen extender, and their effects were compared with extenders containing antibiotics or none. The extenders were evaluated for microbial resistance and their ability to maintain sperm quality in vitro during refrigeration at 16 ± 1 °C for 72 h. To assess antimicrobial efficacy, Enterococcus faecalis was used. Seminal doses stored for 24 h were used for insemination under commercial conditions, and fertility rate and total kits born were evaluated. Results: Adding 0.05% Chitosan to the extender resulted in sperm parameters and bacterial load comparable to those achieved with antibiotics during refrigerated storage, yielding similar fertility rate and total kits born outcomes 24 h post-storage. In contrast, the use EDTA alone or in combination with Chitosan was less effective at controlling Enterococcus faecalis than the antibiotic extenders, which also resulted in a reduction of sperm total motility over storage period (0–72 h) and negatively impacted fertility rate and total kits born. Conclusions: Chitosan’s protective effect on sperm function, combined with its antimicrobial activity, makes it a promising alternative antimicrobial agent for the liquid storage of rabbit seminal AI doses. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The stable physiological structure and rich vascular network of pig ears contribute to distinct thermal characteristics, which can reflect temperature variations. While the temperature of the pig ear does not directly represent core body temperature due to the ear’s role in thermoregulation, thermal infrared imaging offers a feasible approach to analyzing individual pig status. Based on this background, a dataset comprising 23,189 thermal infrared images of pig ears (TIRPigEar) was established. The TIRPigEar dataset was obtained through a pig house inspection robot equipped with an infrared thermal imaging device, with post-processing conducted via manual annotation. By labeling pig ears within these images, a total of 69,567 labeled files were generated, which can be directly used for training pig ear detection models and enabling the analysis of pig temperature information by integrating the corresponding thermal imaging data. To validate the dataset’s utility, it was evaluated across various object detection algorithms. Experimental results show that the dataset achieves the highest precision, recall, and mAP50 on the YOLOv9m model, reaching 97.35%, 98.1%, and 98.6%, respectively. Overall, the TIRPigEar dataset demonstrates optimal performance when applied to the YOLOv9m algorithm. Utilizing thermal infrared imaging technology to detect pig ear information provides a non-contact, rapid, and effective method. Establishing the TIRPigEar dataset is highly significant, as it allows for a valuable resource for AI and precision livestock farming researchers to validate and improve their algorithms. This dataset will support many researchers in advancing precision livestock farming by enabling an efficient way for pig ear temperature analysis. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: The dairy and livestock sector plays a very important role in national economy of India by contributing close to one third of gross income of rural households and nearly half of gross income in case of those without land. Subestrus is the most prevalent, frustrating and challenging problem encountered in postpartum buffaloes. Postpartum subestrus is one of the most prevalent, frustrating and challenging reproductive problem encountered in rural resulting into prolonged inter-calving period, reduced milk production and thus greatly affecting the economy of our farming community. Methods: The present study was carried out on Graded Murrah buffaloes during the period from September 2017 to August 2019 (includes breeding and low breeding season) which were maintained at farm and field. Treatment of sub-estrus lactating graded Murrah buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) using Double PGF2 α (DPG) and Presynch-Ovsynch (POVS) their influence on fertility in farm and field condition during breeding and low breeding season was studied. Total cholesterol and progesterone concentration was recorded during different days/period of protocols. Further, overall per cent conception and pregnancy rates were recorded and compared between two protocols. Result: Progesterone levels increased significantly on day 21 post AI in pregnant buffaloes, whereas decreased significantly in non-pregnant buffaloes both in farm and field during breeding and low breeding season. The overall per cent conception and pregnancy rates were higher in POVS group than DPG group at both farm and field as well as during breeding and low breeding seasons. © 2024 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {Background and Aim: In the global pig farming industry, artificial insemination (AI) is widely used to propagate high-quality genetics using processed semen that can be stored for extended periods. However, boar sperm are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage during storage and cryopreservation because of their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content. This study aimed to systematically review the impact of resveratrol (RVT), a potent antioxidant, on the preservation of boar semen. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Relevant articles were retrieved from databases such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PubMed using specific ★. After a thorough screening, 10 studies were selected for inclusion. Data extracted from these studies included parameters such as sperm motility, viability, DNA integrity, and lipid peroxidation levels. Results: Resveratrol supplementation in boar semen extenders significantly improved sperm quality under various storage conditions, including waterbath and cooled and frozen semen. RVT’s antioxidative properties effectively reduced reactive oxygen species and prevented oxidative stress-related damage to sperm cells. Conclusion: The addition of resveratrol to semen extenders enhances the preservation of boar sperm by mitigating oxidative damage, potentially increasing the success rate of AI in the swine industry. This study highlights the need for further research to optimize RVT dosage and application methods for different semen preservation techniques. Copyright: Prastiya, et al.},

	abstract = {Animal extinction and biodiversity loss are critical issues impacting our planet today. This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach that merges the power of deep learning with the urgent necessity of wildlife conservation to aid ecologists in their fight against animal extinction. Utilizing a labeled and unlabeled dataset obtained from camera trap images from the Hajar Mountains of the United Arab Emirates, we trained and evaluated six different pre-trained deep learning models to assess how well they can be applied in real-world scenarios. Our analysis yielded promising results in accuracy and generalizability, with Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) scores comparing model predictions exceeding 0.6 for all models. Despite the substantial challenge presented by the imbalanced nature of our dataset, our models successfully classified a wide array of species, with our best model (DenseNet121) averaging a weighted accuracy of 72.78% with an F1 score of 0.957. The robustness of our models was further validated by a t-SNE analysis, which revealed coherent clustering of high-dimensional data. We developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application to bring our technology to non-technical users, allowing ecologists to classify images easily and leverage the power of AI in their conservation efforts. This study is a stride forward in leveraging artificial intelligence to aid ecological conservation, demonstrating the potential for machine learning to provide practical, effective solutions in real-world scenarios. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Understanding the factors that drive and hinder technology adoption is critical for companies that try to access customer segments or governmental agencies that want to foster economic, ecological, or social change. By assessing the technological readiness of customer groups, common and individual barriers or opportunities for technology adoption can be observed and translated into technological requirements, business strategies, or policy interventions. Current approaches to assessing such barriers do not provide information on which factors influence technological readiness more than others, limiting the prioritization of targeted technological or political interventions. This research introduces an Explainable Machine Learning (XAI) approach to overcome this limitation. It exemplifies its usability for the Precision Livestock Farming domain, particularly for smart technologies incorporating novel advances in Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things. A random forest machine learning model is introduced to identify clusters of different farmers' technological readiness based on the available features (survey questions). XAI techniques are then deployed to understand the influence of individual features on the prediction outcome, highlighting factors that increase or decrease technological readiness of farmers. The results are assessed for their potential for requirement and business analysis while providing targeted suggestions for technology design. © 2024 The Author(s)},

The 3D reconstruction technology is dedicated to realizing this ideal process. 3D reconstruction technology serves as a transformative tool, enriching our ability to perceive the genuine shape and stereo structure of objects and scenes in the real world. Through combining advanced sensors, image processing algorithms and 3D reconstruction methods, it captures the shape and structural information of targets from multiple perspectives and dimensions, and creates highly realistic 3D models in the virtual environment. With the rapid modernization of agriculture and ongoing technological progress, the demand for more efficient and precise management and monitoring methods in agricultural production is increasing. Traditional observation and measurement methods face challenges such as low efficiency and incomplete data. 3D reconstruction technology provides more accurate and intelligent management tools for smart agriculture. This paper provides a detailed introduction to the research progress based on 3D reconstruction technology in smart agriculture. It delves into the characteristics and development of various sensors and sensing systems, discussing various methods to implement 3D reconstruction technology. Different from applications in industrial environments, agricultural environments and crops are usually complex and variable, and consideration of diverse factors is required for the selection of suitable sensors and reconstruction methods. Therefore, several aspects of applications are summarized, such as agricultural robotics, crop phenotyping, livestock, and the food industry.

On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted in more efficient resource utilization. Nowadays, animal agriculture is much more sustainable with the help of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the rate of AI maturity in animal agriculture provides a roadmap for optimizing its integration into it, which is of great concern to enterprise managers and policymakers. According to the literature, there is no AI maturity model in the animal agriculture sector to assess the latter. The current study was carried out in four phases. First, the literature shed light on the dimensions of AI and its applications in animal agriculture. Second, animal agricultural experts ranked the AI dimensions using the Best-Worst Method (BWM). In the third phase, a model was developed to assess AI maturity across all dimensions of AI technology and AI applications in animal agriculture. Finally, a company maturity assessment tested the proposed model by questionnaire. The research findings show that health monitoring is the most important AI application in animal agriculture. Also, the company under study showed great individual identification maturity.

	abstract = {Accurate aboveground vegetation biomass forecasting is essential for livestock management, climate impact assessments, and ecosystem health. While artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have advanced time series forecasting, a research gap in predicting aboveground biomass time series beyond single values persists. This study introduces RECMO and DirRecMO, two multi-output methods for forecasting aboveground vegetation biomass. Using convolutional neural networks, their efficacy is evaluated across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons on six Kenyan grassland biomass datasets, and compared with that of existing single-output methods (Recursive, Direct, and DirRec) and multi-output methods (MIMO and DIRMO). The results indicate that single-output methods are superior for short-term predictions, while both single-output and multi-output methods exhibit a comparable effectiveness in long-term forecasts. RECMO and DirRecMO outperform established multi-output methods, demonstrating a promising potential for biomass forecasting. This study underscores the significant impact of multi-output size on forecast accuracy, highlighting the need for optimal size adjustments and showcasing the proposed methods’ flexibility in long-term forecasts. Short-term predictions show less significant differences among methods, complicating the identification of the best performer. However, clear distinctions emerge in medium- and long-term forecasts, underscoring the greater importance of method choice for long-term predictions. Moreover, as the forecast horizon extends, errors escalate across all methods, reflecting the challenges of predicting distant future periods. This study suggests advancing hybrid models (e.g., RECMO and DirRecMO) to improve extended horizon forecasting. Future research should enhance adaptability, investigate multi-output impacts, and conduct comparative studies across diverse domains, datasets, and AI algorithms for robust insights. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In nature, and particularly in agriculture, pollination is fundamental for the sustainability of our society. In this context, pollination is a vital process underlying crop yield quality and is responsible for the biodiversity and the standards of the flora. Bees play a crucial role in natural pollination; however, their populations are declining. Robots can help maintain pollination levels while humans work to recover bee populations. Swarm robotics approaches appear promising for robotic pollination. This paper proposes the cooperation between multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), leveraging the advantages of collaborative work for pollination, referred to as Pollinationbots. Pollinationbots is based in swarm behaviors and methodologies to implement more effective pollination strategies, ensuring efficient pollination across various scenarios. The paper presents the architecture of the Pollinationbots system, which was evaluated using the Webots simulator, focusing on path planning and follower behavior. Preliminary simulation results indicate that this is a viable solution for robotic pollination. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Livestock feeding behaviour is an influential research area in animal husbandry and agriculture. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in automated systems for monitoring the behaviour of ruminants. Current automated monitoring systems mainly use motion, acoustic, pressure and image sensors to collect and analyse patterns related to ingestive behaviour, foraging activities and daily intake. The performance evaluation of existing methods is a complex task and direct comparisons between studies is difficult. Several factors prevent a direct comparison, starting from the diversity of data and performance metrics used in the experiments. This review on the analysis of the feeding behaviour of ruminants emphasise the relationship between sensing methodologies, signal processing, and computational intelligence methods. It assesses the main sensing methodologies and the main techniques to analyse the signals associated with feeding behaviour, evaluating their use in different settings and situations. It also highlights the potential of the valuable information provided by automated monitoring systems to expand knowledge in the field, positively impacting production systems and research. The paper closes by discussing future engineering challenges and opportunities in livestock feeding behaviour monitoring. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Insect meal has been proposed as one way for the food system to reduce its reliance on fishmeal and soy meal, given the environmental and human rights problems associated with those inputs. However, insect meal is currently too expensive to compete with fishmeal and soy meal, hindering its adoption in large-scale agriculture. There is little indication that insect meal will become cheaper in the near future, especially as the insect industry encounters barriers such as a lack of large-scale production technologies, limited utilisation of food waste, and a lack of standardisation in insect meal quality. One solution may be to set up production facilities in tropical countries, where energy needs are lower and labour costs are cheaper, but this would mean sacrificing food self-sufficiency and potentially causing job losses. Another solution involves charging a premium for insect-fed meat, but studies reveal that consumers would be unlikely to pay such a premium. Overall, it is unlikely that insect meal will displace fishmeal and soy meal in the near future; it may be more realistic to address the challenges associated with forage fish depletion and soy production via increased agricultural efficiency and targeted domestic and transnational policy instruments. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology in bovine reproduction, revolutionising the agricultural sector globally. In countries like Ethiopia, where livestock is a vital component of the economy and plays a crucial role in ensuring food security and supporting rural livelihoods, advancements in AI hold immense promise and potential. AI has been instrumental in improving the genetic quality of bovine populations, increasing milk and meat production, and facilitating the dissemination of superior genetic traits across diverse breeds. In Ethiopia, traditional breeding practices often face challenges related to limited access to superior breeding stock and inadequate breeding management. The adoption of AI techniques can address these constraints and pave the way for sustainable livestock development. The importance of bovine AI in Ethiopia is underscored by the country's large bovine population, which primarily consists of indigenous zebu cattle breeds known for their adaptability to local environmental conditions. However, challenges persist regarding its widespread adoption and implementation in Ethiopia. Key obstacles include limited access to quality semen from superior sires, inadequate infrastructure and facilities for AI services, insufficient training and capacity building among veterinary professionals and inseminators, and socioeconomic barriers faced by smallholder farmers in accessing AI services. This review aims to critically examine the progress made in bovine AI in Ethiopia, identify the obstacles and constraints hindering its full-scale adoption, and explore prospects and strategies for overcoming these challenges. By delving into the latest research findings, policy frameworks and practical experiences in bovine AI, this review seeks to provide valuable insights and recommendations for leveraging AI technology to enhance livestock productivity, genetic diversity and sustainable agricultural development in Ethiopia. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

	abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasize synchronizing technology and routine life for sustainability. Food and water shortage, and exponentially increasing environmental pollution are the biggest challenges for sustainability. Livestock plays a vital role in developing countries’ economies; the most profitable businesses are breeding dairy and non-dairy products. The productivity of cattle farms is dependent on the health conditions of cattle. Identifying unhealthy cattle and providing suitable treatment is critical. Hence, deploying the Internet of Things (IoT) along with AI systems is one of the potential solutions. This cattle health monitoring system provides monitoring of cattle health to ensure the minimum human intervention. A system has been designed and developed to aid the intelligent cattle health monitoring system by using machine learning techniques. The system includes multiple sensor nodes, each having a body area sensor that is connected to the IoT platform through a controller. As a novelty, the prototype has been trained and evaluated using a federated learning technique. The system warns the owner about specific diseases such as fever, mastitis, foot and mouth disease, and ketosis. The presented results validate the proposal as it diagnoses the prescribed viral diseases precisely. We have implemented the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier for this multiclass problem. Considering the federated learning model, three different datasets are considered as three different clients with 70% train and 30% test data. Client 1, Client 2, and Client 3 represent the cattle farm, veterinary hospital, and veterinary respectively. The sensor nodes are placed on key points of the cattle body while each node collects physiological parameters that are further used to train the prediction system. Additionally, we have developed a user-friendly Android application for the owner to control cattle well-being. A comprehensive comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms existing state-of-the-art systems by showing good accuracy. © 2024},

	abstract = {Digital twin (DT), an artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has garnered significant attention recently due to its potential applications across various industries, including the livestock sector. To facilitate the adoption and integration of DT technologies in livestock farming systems, this study aims to discern and appraise the most recent advancements by assessing scientific and technological progressions. The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature to determine the status of DT application in livestock farm management with its benefits, challenges, and prospects. Scientific databases, PRISMA guidelines, and systematic bibliometric methodologies were used for searching and sorting the most fit articles. This study found that DT technology is new to the livestock industry and mainly used for environmental control, feed management, farm planning, greenhouse gas reduction, and behavior monitoring. Key barriers to DT deployment include high establishment costs, risk of market monopolization, and technical knowledge gaps. The amalgamation of government subsidies, localized technology production, and the provision of training facilities can be instrumental in enabling farmers to overcome the obstacles. The application of DT is limited in monitoring animal behavior and farm environment. However, DT technology has the potential for broader use, such as predicting growth, feed consumption, and improving the supply chain. Although these new areas are yet to be explored in real farm conditions. Along with expanding the new area of using DT in livestock farm management, future collaborative research should concentrate on creating new machine learning and/or deep learning models. © 2024 by the authors.

DigitalUpSkilling uses wearable IoT sensors to observe how individuals perform work activities. Such sensor observations are continuously processed to synthesise an avatar-like kinematic model for each worker who is being trained, referred to as the worker’s digital twins. The framework incorporates novel work activity recognition using generative adversarial network (GAN) and machine learning (ML) models for recognising the types and sequences of work activities by analysing an individual’s kinematic model. Finally, the development of skill proficiency ML is proposed to evaluate each trainee’s proficiency in work activities and the overall task. To illustrate DigitalUpSkilling from wearable IoT-sensor-driven kinematic models to GAN-ML models for work activity recognition and skill proficiency assessment, the paper presents a comprehensive study on how specific meat processing activities in a real-world work environment can be recognised and assessed. In the study, DigitalUpSkilling achieved 99% accuracy in recognising specific work activities performed by meat workers. The study also presents an evaluation of the proficiency of workers by comparing kinematic data from trainees performing work activities.

A robot typically comprises of sensors, manipulators, control system, EOAT/end effectors, and actuators. Developing an accurate and reliable sensor is the first real step in the development of a robot plant doctor. Spectral sensors like visual (RGB), multi-spectral, hyper-spectral, thermal chlorophyll fluorescence, and volatile organic compound (VOCs) sensors are major ones exploited for plant disease detection and monitoring. Robots have not yet been used extensively for agriculture in India, let alone in pathogen management. Still, most of the potential robots are in the prototype stage, major advances are seen in the detection of leaf diseases of crop plants and automated spraying of pesticides. In this chapter, we discussed how robots are employed in agriculture in general and plant pathology in particular. © 2025 Apple Academic Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The scientific discipline of endocrinology has been invaluable to our understanding of the estrous cycle. In the second half of the twentieth century the development of immunoassay technologies provided a rapid and sensitive method to quantify circulating concentrations of reproductive hormones and relate them to stage of the estrous cycle and physiological status of the animal. Ovarian ultrasonography provided the ability to track the growth and regression of ovarian structures within the same animal across the estrous cycle in real time and, in combination with hormonal profiling, accurately identify mechanisms regulating the estrous cycle and early pregnancy. Before this, the best technique had been serial collections with each animal being a single endpoint. The availability of continuous data such as daily hormone concentrations and daily follicular measurements within animals led to the improvement of methods to synchronize estrus in each of the species. Unfortunately, the use of radio-immunoassays has been declining for two decades. While enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays have been developed for many endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine factors, their primary market is human medicine and rodent models of human health, leaving those available for livestock species economically infeasible. Automated sensors such as accelerometers apply the knowledge attained through decades of endocrinology and ultrasonography studies to identify females in estrus and measure parameters of the estrous cycle that are related to fertility. The ability of automated sensors to centralize and assimilate large amounts of behavioral and physiological data from numerous animals will enhance targeted reproductive management in livestock production systems. © 2025},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of antibiotics, penicillin has remained the top choice in clinical medicine. With continuous advancements in biotechnology, penicillin production has become cost-effective and efficient. Genetic engineering techniques have been employed to enhance biosynthetic pathways, leading to the production of new penicillin derivatives with improved properties and increased efficacy against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Advances in bioreactor design, media formulation, and process optimization have contributed to higher yields, reduced production costs, and increased penicillin accessibility. While biotechnological advances have clearly benefited the global production of this life-saving drug, they have also created challenges in terms of waste management. Production fermentation broths from industries contain residual antibiotics, by-products, and other contaminants that pose direct environmental threats, while increased global consumption intensifies the risk of antimicrobial resistance in both the environment and living organisms. The current geographical and spatial distribution of antibiotic and penicillin consumption dramatically reveals a worldwide threat. These challenges are being addressed through the development of novel waste management techniques. Efforts are aimed at both upstream and downstream processing of antibiotic and penicillin production to minimize costs and improve yield efficiency while lowering the overall environmental impact. Yield optimization using artificial intelligence (AI), along with biological and chemical treatment of waste, is also being explored to reduce adverse impacts. The implementation of strict regulatory frameworks and guidelines is also essential to ensure proper management and disposal of penicillin production waste. This review is novel because it explores the key remaining challenges in antibiotic development, the scope of machine learning tools such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) in modern biotechnology-driven production, improved waste management for antibiotics, discovering alternative path to reducing antibiotic use in agriculture through alternative meat production, addressing current practices, and offering effective recommendations. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Individual precision-cooling systems are intended to cool individual cows according to their specific cooling needs. Now, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence and machine-vision capabilities, various precision-cooling techniques and control systems have been proposed, any number of which could prove to be a feasible way to apply precision cooling. Hence, this review provides a comprehensive overview of recently developed and tested systems such as spray cooling, air-forced convection cooling, and waterbed cooling. The feasibility of commercialization of these systems was also evaluated. Additionally, the existing methods used to detect the heat stress-related physiological responses of dairy cows and their adaptability for precision cooling systems were summarized and assessed. Cutting-edge technologies such as wearable detection devices, frequency-modulated, continuous-wave radar, infrared thermography, and computer vision could potentially be used to monitor real-time physiological parameters. In addition, the various automatic-control technologies used to regulate livestock-barn environments (technologies that involve proportional–integral–derivative controls, predictive models, and reinforcement learning) are also reviewed. As the automatic-control system is an aspect scarcely addressed in the context of current dairy-farm operations, only a limited number of control technologies were found to be in use at a dairy farm. The importance of control logic and system was highlighted in the context of precision cooling. This review ends with the conclusion that before real-time heat-stress-monitoring and state-of-the-art control strategies can be integrated into precision cooling systems, more work should be done to determine whether either can significantly improve the effectiveness of currently used cooling systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Early and accurate detection is vital to prevent widespread outbreaks and reduce economic losses. Our research leverages advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning, to develop an automated system for detecting LSD in cattle. We utilized publicly available datasets containing images of healthy cattle, those affected by LSD, and, importantly, cattle with other skin diseases to ensure our model specifically identifies LSD rather than general illness signs. We evaluated over ten pretrained deep learning models, including VGG16 and MobileNetV2, using transfer learning techniques. Through detailed data preprocessing, augmentation, and balancing, we enhanced model performance and generalizability. We assessed the models using crucial medical diagnostics metrics like sensitivity and specificity to minimize false negatives and positives. VGG16 and MobileNetV2 stood out, achieving high accuracy along with excellent sensitivity and specificity, effectively detecting LSD without misclassifying other conditions. This study provides valuable insights into applying deep learning in veterinary diagnostics, contributing to developing reliable AI tools for early LSD detection, ultimately improving animal health management and safeguarding the agricultural economy. © 2024 by the authors.},

The incorporation of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Blockchain has proven to increase biosecurity measures in pig farms, contributing to the prevention of associated diseases and improving the quality of meat production for the well-being of society. Based on this understanding, we have formulated a prototype proposal relevant to Mexico. Our proposal was structured using methodologies that included field visits to two pig farms located in Zapopan, Jalisco, interviews with specialists in veterinary medicine, and a review of relevant literature to understand the current global scenario regarding the digitalization of pig farms in search of the best practices to achieve a “smart farm”. Our results indicate the viability of integrating digital technologies into pig farming and the potential to expand this approach to other farms in Mexico. Specifically, we propose the implementation of IoT devices for monitoring NH3-CO2 levels and temperature, a mobile application for farm surveillance, and Blockchain technology for tracking the supply chain of raw materials and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, a microfluidic biosensor can be utilized for early detection of swine stress. To facilitate the widespread adoption of these technologies, we suggest promoting this type of initiative within the livestock industry and encouraging the integration of practices that prioritize technological advancements and animal welfare. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Heat stress impacts ruminant livestock production on varied levels in this alarming climate breakdown scenario. The drastic effects of the global climate change-associated heat stress in ruminant livestock demands constructive evaluation of animal performance bordering on effective monitoring systems. In this climate-smart digital age, adoption of advanced and developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies is gaining traction for efficient heat stress management. AI has widely penetrated the climate sensitive ruminant livestock sector due to its promising and plausible scope in assessing production risks and the climate resilience of ruminant livestock. Significant improvement has been achieved alongside the adoption of novel AI algorithms to evaluate the performance of ruminant livestock. These AI-powered tools have the robustness and competence to expand the evaluation of animal performance and help in minimising the production losses associated with heat stress in ruminant livestock. Advanced heat stress management through automated monitoring of heat stress in ruminant livestock based on behaviour, physiology and animal health responses have been widely accepted due to the evolution of technologies like machine learning (ML), neural networks and deep learning (DL). The AI-enabled tools involving automated data collection, pre-processing, data wrangling, development of appropriate algorithms, and deployment of models assist the livestock producers in decision-making based on real-time monitoring and act as early-stage warning systems to forecast disease dynamics based on prediction models. Due to the convincing performance, precision, and accuracy of AI models, the climate-smart livestock production imbibes AI technologies for scaled use in the successful reducing of heat stress in ruminant livestock, thereby ensuring sustainable livestock production and safeguarding the global economy. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Livestock health and welfare monitoring is a tedious and labour-intensive task previously performed manually by humans. However, with recent technological advancements, the livestock industry has adopted the latest AI and computer vision-based techniques empowered by deep learning (DL) models that, at the core, act as decision-making tools. These models have previously been used to address several issues, including individual animal identification, tracking animal movement, body part recognition, and species classification. However, over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in using these models to examine the relationship between livestock behaviour and associated health problems. Several DL-based methodologies have been developed for livestock behaviour recognition, necessitating surveying and synthesising state-of-the-art. Previously, review studies were conducted in a very generic manner and did not focus on a specific problem, such as behaviour recognition. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no review study that focuses on the use of DL specifically for livestock behaviour recognition. As a result, this systematic literature review (SLR) is being carried out. The review was performed by initially searching several popular electronic databases, resulting in 1101 publications. Further assessed through the defined selection criteria, 126 publications were shortlisted. These publications were filtered using quality criteria that resulted in the selection of 44 high-quality primary studies, which were analysed to extract the data to answer the defined research questions. According to the results, DL solved 13 behaviour recognition problems involving 44 different behaviour classes. 23 DL models and 24 networks were employed, with CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5, and YOLOv4 being the most common models, and VGG16, CSPDarknet53, GoogLeNet, ResNet101, and ResNet50 being the most popular networks. Ten different matrices were utilised for performance evaluation, with precision and accuracy being the most commonly used. Occlusion and adhesion, data imbalance, and the complex livestock environment were the most prominent challenges reported by the primary studies.

	abstract = {It is a challenging and meaningful task to carry out UAV-based livestock monitoring in high-altitude (more than 4500 m on average) and cold regions (annual average – 4 °C) on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The purpose of artificial intelligence (AI) is to execute automated tasks and to solve practical problems in actual applications by combining the software technology with the hardware carrier to create integrated advanced devices. Only in this way, the maximum value of AI could be realized. In this paper, a real-time tracking system with dynamic target tracking ability is proposed. It is developed based on the tracking-by-detection architecture using YOLOv7 and Deep SORT algorithms for target detection and tracking, respectively. In response to the problems encountered in the tracking process of complex and dense scenes, our work (1) Uses optical flow to compensate the Kalman filter, to solve the problem of mismatch between the target bounding box predicted by the Kalman filter (KF) and the input when the target detection in the current frame is complex, thereby improving the prediction accuracy; (2) Using a low confidence trajectory filtering method to reduce false positive trajectories generated by Deep SORT, thereby mitigating the impact of unreliable detection on target tracking. (3) A visual servo controller has been designed for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to reduce the impact of rapid movement on tracking and ensure that the target is always within the field of view of the UAV camera, thereby achieving automatic tracking tasks. Finally, the system was tested using Tibetan yaks on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau as tracking targets, and the results showed that the system has real-time multi tracking ability and ideal visual servo effect in complex and dense scenes. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {As the demand for food surges and the agricultural sector undergoes a transformative shift towards sustainability and efficiency, the need for precise and proactive measures to ensure the health and welfare of livestock becomes paramount. In the egg and hatchery industry, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has emerged as a cutting-edge, non-destructive technique for fast and accurate egg quality analysis, including detecting chick embryo mortality. However, the high cost and operational complexity compared to conventional RGB imaging are significant bottlenecks in the widespread adoption of HSI technology. To overcome these hurdles and unlock the full potential of HSI, a promising solution is hyperspectral image reconstruction from standard RGB images. This study aims to reconstruct hyperspectral images from RGB images for non-destructive early prediction of chick embryo mortality. Initially, the performance of different image reconstruction algorithms, such as HRNET, MST++, Restormer, and EDSR were compared to reconstruct the hyperspectral images of the eggs in the early incubation period. Later, the reconstructed spectra were used to differentiate live from dead embryos eggs using the XGBoost and Random Forest classification methods. Among the reconstruction methods, HRNET showed impressive reconstruction performance with MRAE of 0.0955, RMSE of 0.0159, and PSNR of 36.79 dB. This study motivated the idea that harnessing imaging technology integrated with smart sensors and data analytics has the potential to improve automation, enhance biosecurity, and optimize resource management towards sustainable agriculture 4.0. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Since the agricultural sector is one of the main drivers responsible for the transgression of planetary boundaries, there is an urgent need to reduce its environmental impacts. To address this issue, international institutions advocate for digital agriculture, but formalised and comprehensive assessment of its environmental impacts is still lacking. This systematic review aims at studying papers dedicated to the environmental assessment of the use of digital technologies in agriculture (DATs), i.e. of digital agriculture. In the 69 studies selected by the PRISMA method, most of the DATs dealt with crop production, supporting technical production management (e.g. fertilisation or irrigation). Almost a third of DATs were robots or automation tools. Out of the selected studies, 36 applied the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework. A focus was placed on these 36 case studies, which were examined in the light of the four LCA standardised stages, i.e. goal and scope, life cycle inventory (LCI), life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and interpretation. Our review results show that most of the studies aimed to assess the environmental impacts of digitalising an agricultural system using either a mass or surface-based functional unit, or sometimes both. The system boundaries seldomly included the DAT life cycle which were sometimes modelled with proxies and assumptions at the LCI stage to address data gaps. Assumptions were also needed to quantify the effects of DAT on the agricultural system, such as yield benefits or food waste reduction. At the LCIA stage, midpoint indicators were often selected. Turning to the interpretation step, it is worth noting that few studies carried out uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. Finally, most of these 36 studies concluded that digitalisation reduced the environmental impacts of the agricultural system due to efficiency gains, or the use of electricity instead of fossil fuel. Conversely, three studies determined that digitalisation increased the environmental impacts of their agricultural system in terms of toxicity, mineral resource use, marine eutrophication, land use and ionising radiations, as high technologies (robots and drones) were being assessed in these works. Based on our review, recommendations were made on how to conduct LCA when assessing the environmental impacts of digitalising an agricultural system. Research perspectives for DAT environmental assessment were also discussed that take into consideration their emerging nature, their multifunctionality and the rebound effects they may generate. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Livestock and poultry processing can often include the slaughtering, cutting, and deep processing into meat products for consumption. Among them, cutting is a pivotal step to determine the shape, quality, and taste of the meat, in order to significantly promote the added value and market competitiveness of the products. Intelligent cutting technology has been gradually used in the field of livestock and poultry processing in recent years, particularly with the development of intelligent technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine vision. Production efficiency can be expected to enhance product quality with low labor intensity. This review aims to summarize the research advance on intelligent cutting technologies for livestock and poultry processing. Firstly, the current state was reviewed in the research of machine vision, tactile sensing, virtual reality (VR), and computed tomography (CT) in livestock and poultry processing. Each technology contributed uniquely to the precision, efficiency, and quality control. Machine vision was used to precisely and rapidly identify and classify meat cuts, especially for high consistency and quality. Tactile sensing technology was used to detect the physical properties, such as texture and firmness, which were critical for the quality assessment. VR technology was used to offer immersive training environments for workers to improve skill acquisition and operational efficiency. CT technology was to provide detailed imaging for accurate cutting and grading, in order to reduce waste and increase yield. The meat factory unit integrated these technologies into a cohesive system, streamlining operations and maximizing productivity. Some challenges still remained in the field behind these advancements. One major challenge was to integrate these diverse technologies into a seamless automated system, in order to operate under the demanding conditions of meat processing environments with robust hardware. Additionally, standardized protocols and practices were required to ensure the compatibility and interoperability among different systems and technologies. Several solutions were then proposed to develop more advanced machine learning for the high accuracy and efficiency of automated systems. The research and development were invested to enhance the durability and reliability of hardware. The industry-wide standards and best practices were required to establish for the technology integration. Collaboration was also required among researchers, industry stakeholders, and regulatory bodies. Looking ahead, the production efficiency can be improved to ensure food safety, and then enhance the industrial competitiveness in the development trend of intelligent cutting technology for livestock and poultry processing. The continuous evolution of intelligent technologies can also be expected to drive the industry towards greater automation and precision, leading to more sustainable and efficient processing. The findings can provide a comprehensive reference and insights into the current state and future directions of intelligent livestock and poultry processing. The livestock and poultry processing industry can achieve significant advancements, in terms of productivity, quality, and sustainability under intelligent technologies. This progression can also contribute to the broader societal goals of food security and resource efficiency. Therefore, intelligent cutting technologies can be realized to promote the development of intelligence, efficiency, and sustainability in livestock and poultry processing. © 2024 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {[Significance] The rapid development of artificial intelligence and automation has greatly expanded the scope of agricultural automation, with applications such as precision farming using unmanned machinery, robotic grazing in outdoor environments, and automated harvesting by orchard-picking robots. Collaborative operations among multiple agricultural robots enhance production efficiency and reduce labor costs, driving the development of smart agriculture. Multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a pivotal role by ensuring accurate mapping and localization, which are essential for the effective management of unmanned farms. Compared to single-robot SLAM, multi-robot systems offer several advantages, including higher localization accuracy, larger sensing ranges, faster response times, and improved real-time performance. These capabilities are particularly valuable for completing complex tasks efficiently. However, deploying multi-robot SLAM in agricultural settings presents significant challenges. Dynamic environmental factors, such as crop growth, changing weather patterns, and livestock movement, increase system uncertainty. Additionally, agricultural terrains vary from open fields to irregular greenhouses, requiring robots to adjust their localization and path-planning strategies based on environmental conditions. Communication constraints, such as unstable signals or limited transmission range, further complicate coordination between robots. These combined challenges make it difficult to implement multi-robot SLAM effectively in agricultural environments. To unlock the full potential of multi-robot SLAM in agriculture, it is essential to develop optimized solutions that address the specific technical demands of these scenarios. [Progress] Existing review studies on multi-robot SLAM mainly focus on a general technological perspective, summarizing trends in the development of multi-robot SLAM, the advantages and limitations of algorithms, universally applicable conditions, and core issues of key technologies. However, there is a lack of analysis specifically addressing multi-robot SLAM under the characteristics of complex agricultural scenarios. This study focuses on the main features and applications of multi-robot SLAM in complex agricultural scenarios. The study analyzes the advantages and limitations of multi-robot SLAM, as well as its applicability and application scenarios in agriculture, focusing on four key components: multi-sensor data fusion, collaborative localization, collaborative map building, and loopback detection. From the perspective of collaborative operations in multi-robot SLAM, the study outlines the classification of SLAM frameworks, including three main collaborative types: centralized, distributed, and hybrid. Based on this, the study summarizes the advantages and limitations of mainstream multi-robot SLAM frameworks, along with typical scenarios in robotic agricultural operations where they are applicable. Additionally, it discusses key issues faced by multi-robot SLAM in complex agricultural scenarios, such as low accuracy in mapping and localization during multi-sensor fusion, restricted communication environments during multi-robot collaborative operations, and low accuracy in relative pose estimation between robots. [Conclusions and Prospects] To enhance the applicability and efficiency of multi-robot SLAM in complex agricultural scenarios, future research needs to focus on solving these critical technological issues. Firstly, the development of enhanced data fusion algorithms will facilitate improved integration of sensor information, leading to greater accuracy and robustness of the system. Secondly, the combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques is expected to empower robots to better interpret environmental patterns, adapt to dynamic changes, and make more effective real-time decisions. Thirdly, large language models will enhance human-robot interaction by enabling natural language commands, improving collaborative operations. Finally, the integration of digital twin technology will support more intelligent path planning and decision-making processes, especially in unmanned farms and livestock management systems. The convergence of digital twin technology with SLAM is projected to yield innovative solutions for intelligent perception and is likely to play a transformative role in the realm of agricultural automation. This synergy is anticipated to revolutionize the approach to agricultural tasks, enhancing their efficiency and reducing the reliance on labor. © 2024 Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The integration of computer vision technology has become a catalyst for transformative change in precision farming, particularly concerning productivity and welfare. This review paper delineates the central role of computer vision in precision poultry farming, focusing on its applications in non-contact monitoring methods that employ advanced sensors and cameras to enhance farm biosecurity and bird observation without disturbance. We delved into the multifaceted advancements such as the utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for behavior analysis and health monitoring, evidenced by the high accuracy sorting of eggs and identification of health concerns within target-dense farm environments. The review paper underscores advancements in precision agriculture, including accurate egg weight estimation and egg classification within cage-free systems, paralleling the poultry sector's evolution towards more ethical farming practices. Moreover, it addresses the progress in poultry growth monitoring and examines case studies of commercial farms, showcasing how these innovations are being practically applied to enhance productivity and animal welfare. Challenges remain, particularly in terms of environmental variability and data annotation for deep learning models. Nevertheless, the review emphasizes the scope for future innovations like voice-controlled robotics and virtual reality applications, which have the potential to enhance poultry farming to new levels of efficiency, humanity, and sustainability.

	abstract = {The use of a robot cleaner for manure removal improves housing conditions for dairy cows in the face of labor shortages. However, current robot cleaners follow programmed fixed routes without considering the dynamic behaviors of cows. This cleaning approach is less efficient and leads to more cow-robot encounters or collisions, thus affecting animal welfare. To address these issues, this paper (1) developed heatmap models for cow locations and defecation behaviors; (2) proposed a dynamic path planning approach for the manure robot cleaner using Grid-based Reinforcement Learning; (3) incorporated cow location information and defecation behavior into the path planning process; (4) compared the performance of the proposed approach with two different cleaning methods: the current fixed programmed cleaning in practice and the ideal path produced by simulated annealing for traveling salesman problem. The simulations mimic the situation in a barn at Dairy Campus of Wageningen Livestock Research located in Leeuwarden (the Netherlands). Obviously, the best performance was achieved when the route was executed without cows present, resulting in no cow-robot collision. However, with cows present, the proposed dynamic path planning strategy achieved a 67.6% reduction in cow-robot encounters while maintaining 85.4% of the cleaning performance compared to the current programmed fixed routes. Compared to the ideal path produced by simulated annealing for traveling salesman problem, the proposed dynamic path planning approach achieved 5% better cleaning performance, at the cost of 25% more cow-robot encounters due to its longer working path. We conclude the proposed grid-based Reinforcement Learning solution for manure robots in barns cleaned most efficient with the least interference with cow traffic. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Effective livestock management has become essential owing to an aging workforce and the growth of large-scale farming operations in the agricultural industry. Conventional monitoring methods, primarily reliant on manual observation, are increasingly reaching their limits, necessitating the development of innovative automated solutions. This study developed a system, termed mixed-ELAN, for real-time sow and piglet behavior detection using an extended ELAN architecture with diverse kernel sizes. The standard convolution operations within the ELAN framework were replaced with MixConv using diverse kernel sizes to enhance feature learning capabilities. To ensure high reliability, a performance evaluation of all techniques was conducted using a k-fold cross-validation (k = 3). The proposed architecture was applied to YOLOv7 and YOLOv9, yielding improvements of 1.5% and 2%, with mean average precision scores of 0.805 and 0.796, respectively, compared with the original models. Both models demonstrated significant performance improvements in detecting behaviors critical for piglet growth and survival, such as crushing and lying down, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. These advances highlight the potential of AI and computer vision in agriculture, as well as the system’s benefits for improving animal welfare and farm management efficiency. The proposed architecture enhances the real-time monitoring and understanding of livestock behavior, establishing improved benchmarks for smart farming technologies and enabling further innovation in livestock management. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The primary aim of this study was to explore cybersecurity threats in agriculture 4.0 and 5.0, as well as possible mitigation strategies. A secondary method was employed involving narrative review in which many studies on cybersecurity were sampled and analyzed. The study showed that the main risks that increase cybersecurity threats to agricultural organizations include poor cybersecurity practices, lack of regulations and policies on cybersecurity, and outdated IT software. Moreover, the review indicated that the main cybersecurity threat in agriculture 4.0 and 5.0 involves denial of service attacks that target servers and disrupt the functioning of relevant smart technologies, including equipment for livestock tracking, climate monitoring, logistics and warehousing, and crop monitoring. The analysis also revealed that malware attacks occur when hackers change the code of a system application to access sensitive farm-related data and may alter the operations of the digitized systems. Some of the impacts of cybersecurity breaches were noted to include data loss, reduced efficiency of digitized systems, and reduced food security. A crucial mitigation strategy against cybersecurity threats includes using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and quantum computing to improve malware detection in Internet of Things (IoT) digital equipment and ensure faster response to any threats. The other mitigation measures include training employees on best cybersecurity practices and creating guidelines and regulatory standards on best cybersecurity practices. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Since their discovery, the prolonged and widespread use of antibiotics in veterinary and agricultural production has led to numerous problems, particularly the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). In addition, other anthropogenic factors accelerate the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and amplify their impact. In agricultural environments, animals, manure, and wastewater are the vectors of ARGs that facilitate their spread to the environment and humans via animal products, water, and other environmental pathways. Therefore, this review comprehensively analyzed the current status, removal methods, and future directions of ARGs on farms. This article 1) investigates the origins of ARGs on farms, the pathways and mechanisms of their spread to surrounding environments, and various strategies to mitigate their spread; 2) determines the multiple factors influencing the abundance of ARGs on farms, the pathways through which ARGs spread from farms to the environment, and the effects and mechanisms of non-antibiotic factors on the spread of ARGs; 3) explores methods for controlling ARGs in farm wastes; and 4) provides a comprehensive summary and integration of research across various fields, proposing that in modern smart farms, emerging technologies can be integrated through artificial intelligence to control or even eliminate ARGs. Moreover, challenges and future research directions for controlling ARGs on farms are suggested. © 2024},

	abstract = {Cultured Meat (CM) is a growing field in cellular agriculture, driven by the environmental impact of conventional meat production, which contributes to climate change and occupies ≈70% of arable land. As demand for meat alternatives rises, research in this area expands. CM production relies on tissue engineering techniques, where a limited number of animal cells are cultured in vitro and processed to create meat-like tissue comprising muscle and adipose components. Currently, CM is primarily produced on a small scale in pilot facilities. Producing a large cell mass based on suitable cell sources and bioreactors remains challenging. Advanced manufacturing methods and innovative materials are required to subsequently process this cell mass into CM products on a large scale. Consequently, CM is closely linked with biofabrication, a suite of technologies for precisely arranging cellular aggregates and cell-material composites to construct specific structures, often using robotics. This review provides insights into contemporary biomedical biofabrication technologies, focusing on significant advancements in muscle and adipose tissue biofabrication for CM production. Novel materials for biofabricating CM are also discussed, emphasizing their edibility and incorporation of healthful components. Finally, initial studies on biofabricated CM are examined, addressing current limitations and future challenges for large-scale production. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {In an era of increasing pressure to achieve sustainable agriculture, the optimization of livestock feed for enhancing yield and minimizing environmental impact is a paramount objective. This study presents a pioneering approach towards this goal, using rumen microbiome data to predict the efficacy of feed additives in dairy cattle. We collected an extensive dataset that includes methane emissions from 2,190 Holstein cows distributed across 34 distinct sites. The cows were divided into control and experimental groups in a double-blind, unbiased manner, accounting for variables such as age, days in lactation, and average milk yield. The experimental groups were administered one of four leading commercial feed additives: Agolin, Kexxtone, Allimax, and Relyon.Methane emissions were measured individually both before the administration of additives and over a subsequent 12-week period. To develop our predictive model for additive efficacy, rumen microbiome samples were collected from 510 cows from the same herds prior to the study’s onset. These samples underwent deep metagenomic shotgun sequencing, yielding an average of 15.7 million reads per sample. Utilizing innovative artificial intelligence techniques, we successfully estimated the efficacy of these feed additives across different farms. The model’s robustness was further confirmed through validation with independent cohorts, affirming its generalizability and reliability. Our results underscore the transformative capability of using targeted feed additive strategies to both optimize dairy yield and milk composition, and to significantly reduce methane emissions. Specifically, our predictive model demonstrates a scenario where its application could guide the assignment of additives to farms where they are most effective. In doing so, we could achieve an average potential reduction of over 27% in overall emissions. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {In this work, issues of water separation and purification are addressed, where, in order to achieve the desired results, it is necessary to use several disciplines such as classical physics, biotechnology, automatic control, automation, and applications of industry 4.0. Further, the need for comprehensive and automated solutions for rainwater treatment in the agricultural sector is addressed. This research focuses on designing and implementing a system adapted to these needs using Siemens technologies. The methodology ranges from the design of the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) to the implementation of the interface, incorporating Siemens technologies for data acquisition, electrical connections, treatment programming, and PID controller design. The results show significant advances in the development of the system, highlighting the effectiveness of automation and the HMI-PLC human–machine interface in process monitoring and control. These findings support the viability of a comprehensive rainwater treatment system for the agricultural sector, with important implications for water efficiency, environmental preservation, and increased productivity in agricultural and livestock activities. The contribution of this work is the relationship between engineering and research focused on industrial processes. The scientific contribution is to obtain the dynamic models and apply two strategies to obtain the gains of the PID controller. The first method is performed through the proposal of a Hurwitz polynomial, and the second is performed through genetic algorithms (GA), where they are implemented in a controller that is commonly used in the industry. The technological part includes the integration of work (schemes, programming, and communications) so that the result is as close to what was expected. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {By melding the capabilities of robotics with the agility of edge computing, Robotic Edge System (RES) exemplifies the next generation of Internet Intelligent Service Systems, delivering incredible efficiency and adaptability across diverse real world applications. Inevitably, RES is susceptible to mechanical disruptions of robots, particularly when some tasks are assigned to faulty ones, leading to uncertain failures and performance degradation. Due to communication and latency constraints, it is not always feasible to rely on edge/cloud computing infrastructure for system recovery. To address these issues, a UAV-as-a-Service (UAVaaS) approach is proposed that leverages the mobility of UAVs to enhance system resilience. Specifically, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is utilized to assign tasks dynamically among active UAVs to achieve system recovery in a livestock monitoring scenario. Additionally, a Dual Noise Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DNDDPG)-based mechanism is proposed to minimize system recovery time and energy consumption. The proposed DNDDPG enhances exploration and decision-making during training by integrating parameter noise and behavioral noise into the classic Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism can achieve convergence within 100 episodes, thereby effectively minimizing the time and energy required for system recovery.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The integration of digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has marked the onset of a new era of efficient sheep farming in multiple aspects ranging from the general well-being of sheep to advanced web-based management applications. The resultant improvement in sheep health and consequently better farming yield has already started to benefit both farmers and veterinarians. The predictive analytical models embedded with machine learning (giving sense to machines) has helped better decision-making and has enabled farmers to derive most out of their farms. This is evident in the ability of farmers to remotely monitor livestock health by wearable devices that keep track of animal vital signs and behaviour. Additionally, veterinarians now employ advanced AI-based diagnostics for efficient parasite detection and control. Overall, digitalization and AI have completely transformed traditional farming practices in livestock animals. However, there is a pressing need to optimize digital sheep farming, allowing sheep farmers to appreciate and adopt these innovative systems. To fill this gap, this review aims to provide available digital and AI-based systems designed to aid precision farming of sheep, offering an up-to-date understanding on the subject. Various contemporary techniques, such as sky shepherding, virtual fencing, advanced parasite detection, automated counting and behaviour tracking, anomaly detection, precision nutrition, breeding support, and several mobile-based management applications are currently being utilized in sheep farms and appear to be promising. Although artificial intelligence and machine learning may represent key features in the sustainable development of sheep farming, they present numerous challenges in application. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Animal violence is a global problem that affects millions of animals every year. It can manifest itself in various forms, such as abandonment, physical abuse, and commercial exploitation. Animal violence has a negative impact on animal welfare, but it can also have consequences for society at large. Detecting animal violence is a major challenge. Traditional methods, such as bystander reporting, may be insufficient to identify all cases of abuse. Automated detection methods, such as machine vision, may be a valuable tool to improve the detection of animal violence. This study evaluated the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks, coupled with pose estimation, in detecting animal violence in videos. A dataset of animal violence videos was created and preprocessed to improve model performance. Several detection models, such as YOLOV7, VGG-16, VGG-19, GoogleNet and ResNet, were implemented, of which, they were evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. Accordingly, the results showed that YOLOV7, in combination with pose estimation, obtained the best performance metrics. The model demonstrated an accuracy of 93.49%, precision of 98% and sensitivity of 88%. suggest that YOLOV7, together with pose estimation, is an effective method for detecting animal violence. The model provides a comprehensive approach to identify violent behaviors towards animals and can contribute to the automation and improvement of the identification of such behaviors. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Feeding remains a critical component in rabbit farming. In rabbit production, precise feeding is imperative, given its significant role in augmenting feed efficiency, curtailing farming expenses, reducing disease prevalence and mortality rates, and lessening environmental pollution. This study presents the design and development of a rabbit feeding robot that synergises mobile robotics and mechanical arm technology, aiming for exact feed dispensation within rabbit hutches through a mechanism that precisely quantifies feed volume. The robot developed for this purpose notably minimises feed fragmentation and mitigates stress responses in rabbits, thus facilitating unsupervised, precise feeding tailored to varied dietary needs. Experimental outcomes, garnered within a rabbit hutch, reveal that the mobile robot operated at velocities between 0.05 and 0.20 m s−1. Its navigation and positioning accuracy showed a speed deviation of 1.2 %, a lateral deviation of 5.3 mm, a longitudinal deviation of 7.6 mm, and an angular deviation of 1.1°. The rabbit feeding robot demonstrated a feed quantitative error of 4.3%. At a designated feeding point, the time cycles for dispensing feed across three boxes were recorded as 40.6 s, 50.1 s, and 24.3 s, achieving success rates of 96.3 %, 98.8 %, and 100.0 %, respectively. These results substantiate the practical applicability of the rabbit feeding robot in farming production, thus fostering the progression of intelligent agricultural practices. © 2024 IAgrE},

	abstract = {The agricultural sector is amidst an industrial revolution driven by the integration of sensing, communication, and artificial intelligence (AI). Within this context, the internet of things (IoT) takes center stage, particularly in facilitating remote livestock monitoring. Challenges persist, particularly in effective field communication, adequate coverage, and long-range data transmission. This study focuses on employing LoRa communication for livestock monitoring in mountainous pastures in the north-western Alps in Italy. The empirical assessment tackles the complexity of predicting LoRa path loss attributed to diverse land-cover types, highlighting the subtle difficulty of gateway deployment to ensure reliable coverage in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the high expense of densely deploying end devices makes it difficult to fully analyze LoRa link behavior, hindering a complete understanding of networking coverage in mountainous environments. This study aims to elucidate the stability of LoRa link performance in spatial dimensions and ascertain the extent of reliable communication coverage achievable by gateways in mountainous environments. Additionally, an innovative deep learning approach was proposed to accurately estimate path loss across challenging terrains. Remote sensing contributes to land-cover recognition, while Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) enhances the path loss model’s precision. Through rigorous implementation and comprehensive evaluation using collected experimental data, this deep learning approach significantly curtails estimation errors, outperforming established models. Our results demonstrate that our prediction model outperforms established models with a reduction in estimation error to less than 5 dB, marking a 2X improvement over state-of-the-art models. Overall, this study signifies a substantial advancement in IoT-driven livestock monitoring, presenting robust communication and precise path loss prediction in rugged landscapes. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Excessive nitrate consumption has been linked to potential health risks in humans. Thus, understanding nitrate levels in staple foods such as cow milk can provide insights into their health implications. This study meticulously examined nitrate concentrations in 70 cow milk samples from traditional and industrialized cattle farming systems in Fars province, Iran. A combination of deterministic modeling, a probabilistic approach, and six artificial intelligence algorithms was employed to determine health risk assessments. The data disclosed average nitrate concentrations of 32.63 mg/L in traditional farming and 34.95 mg/L in industrialized systems, presenting no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). The Hazard Quotient (HQ) was deployed to gauge potential health threats, underscoring heightened vulnerability in children, who exhibited HQ values ranging from 0.05 to 0.58 (mean = 0.19) in contrast to adults, whose values spanned 0.01 to 0.16 (mean = 0.05). Monte Carlo simulations enriched the risk assessment, demarcating the 5th and 95th percentile nitrate concentrations for children at 0.07 and 0.39, respectively. In children, pivotal interactions that influenced HQ encompassed those between nitrate concentration and consumption rate, as well as nitrate concentration and body weight. The interplay between nitrate concentration and consumption rate was most consequential for the adult cohort. Among the algorithms assessed for HQ prediction, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) was optimal for children and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) for adults, with nitrate concentration being a key determinant. The results underscore the imperative for rigorous oversight of milk nitrate concentrations, highlighting the enhanced susceptibility of children and emphasizing the need for preventive strategies and enlightened consumption. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Salmonella spp. and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are significant foodborne zoonotic pathogens that impact the health of livestock, farmers, and the general public. This study aimed to identify biosecurity measures (BSMs) against these pathogens on swine farms in Europe, the United States, and Canada. Overall, 1,529 articles from three scientific databases were screened manually and with the artificial intelligence (AI) tool ASReview. We identified 54 BSMs from 32 articles, primarily focused on Salmonella spp. control. Amongst the extracted BSMs, only five measures for Salmonella spp. control, namely, ‘acidification of feed’, ‘acidification of drinking water’, ‘rodent control’, ‘all-in and all-out production’, and ‘disinfection’ had sufficient observations to conduct a meta-analysis. Of these five, acidification and rodent control were found to be protective measures, that is, their summary odds ratios in the corresponding meta-analyses were lower than 1, indicating lower odds of Salmonella spp. presence on farms which implemented these BSM compared to farms which did not implement them (odds ratio [OR] around 0.25). All-in and all-out production showed a non-significant protective effect (OR = 0.71), while disinfection showed a statistically non-significant lack of association between disinfection and the presence of Salmonella spp. on the farm (OR = 1.03). For HEV, no meta-analysis could be performed. According to multiple articles, two BSMs were significantly associated with a lower risk of HEV presence, namely, disinfecting vehicles (OR = 0.30) and quarantining pigs before introducing them on the farm (OR = 0.48). A risk of bias assessment for each included article revealed a high risk in the majority of the articles, mainly due to selection and performance bias. This emphasises the lack of standardised, high-quality study designs and robust empirical evidence linking BSM implementation to pathogen reduction. The limited data available for meta-analysis, coupled with the high risk of bias (RoB) in the literature, highlights the urgent need for more substantial evidence on the effectiveness of BSMs in mitigating the transmission and spread of zoonotic pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and HEV on pig farms.

	abstract = {In-vitro meat production has entered into the phase of pilot-commercial scale production from the conceptual-laboratory phase. The main challenge for in-vitro meat production on a commercial scale is the very high cost of its production, mainly due to the cost of cell culture media, growth regulators, and the requirement of highly skilled manpower. The development of serum-free and animal-free culture media with plant, microbial, and fungi-derived compounds through recombinant technology and media recycling is crucial for scaling up in-vitro meat production and reducing the price of the end products. The proper design of bioreactors specific to in-vitro meat production, their automation, utilization of natural and edible scaffolds, and microcarriers made up of edible materials are the present focus of researchers. The co-culturing by proliferating various cells such as adipocytes, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells are applied for imparting textural and organoleptic attributes to developed products similar to conventional meat. The industrial process to produce in-vitro meat needs a clear synergy between the biological, chemical, technical, and industrial fields because at the moment the main research focus is on the development and improvement of cell lines available to set up cell culture and culture media, bioreactors, cell lines, scaffolding, and biofabrication. The research on in-vitro meat is limited by the fact that from the industry the protocols are not properly divulgated.  © 2024 Pavan Kumar et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {With the advancement of AI and big data technology, the livestock industry in Qinghai Province has encountered a significant opportunity for livestock monitoring and management. The abundance of image data has provided a new driving force for economic development, but variations in lighting, background, and animal posture present challenges for target detection. To adapt to the plateau environment, continuous innovation and optimization of algorithms are necessary.In order to address the challenges in livestock monitoring, a large number of image data of cattle and sheep were collected through widespread deployment of cameras in Qinghai Province. After thorough investigation of YOLO series models, it was determined that YOLOv8 outperformed YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7 in accuracy while also demonstrating superior stability compared to YOLOv9. As a result, YOLOv8 was selected as the base model for optimization leading to the development of a new object detection model - YOLOV8-ZX. During the optimization process, several innovative strategies were implemented including selecting ODC-FPN as the backbone network to enhance feature extraction capability; introducing c2f-cam-Neck structure to improve recognition ability in complex backgrounds; unifying object detection head and integrating attention mechanism (Dy-Head)[2] which not only improved generalization performance but also significantly reduced computational complexity. These optimizations enabled YOLOv8-ZX to maintain excellent detection accuracy and stability even in complex and variable environments. Furthermore, introduction of attention mechanism enhanced network's ability to identify key features thereby improving accuracy and robustness of detection. Compared with YOLOV8 model alone,YOLOV8-ZX demonstrated 4.4% increase in mAP50 , 5.4% increase MAP50-95, and 3.7% decrease box damage. Experimental results indicate that optimizedYolo v8 model exhibits exceptional generalization performance & robustness when addressing livestock detection tasks within Qinghai province thus providing an efficient & practical technical solution for livestock monitoring. These research findings not only promote application computer vision within animal husbandry but also provide effective reference solutions similar target detections problems within similar environments. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Since the last two decades, financial markets have exhibited several transformations owing to recurring crises episodes that has led to the development of alternative assets. Particularly, the commodity market has attracted attention from investors and hedgers. However, the operational research stream has also developed substantially based on the growth of the artificial intelligence field, which includes machine learning and deep learning. The choice of algorithms in both machine learning and deep learning is case-sensitive. Hence, AI practitioners should first attempt solutions related to machine learning algorithms, and if such solutions are unsatisfactory, they must apply deep learning algorithms. Using this perspective, this study aims to investigate the potential of various deep learning basic algorithms for forecasting selected commodity prices. Formally, we use the Bloomberg Commodity Index (noted by the Global Aggregate Index) and its five component indices: Bloomberg Agriculture Subindex, Bloomberg Precious Metals Subindex, Bloomberg Livestock Subindex, Bloomberg Industrial Metals Subindex, and Bloomberg Energy Subindex. Based on daily data from January 2002 (the beginning wave of commodity markets' financialization) to December 2020, results show the effectiveness of the Long Short-Term Memory method as a forecasting tool and the superiority of the Bloomberg Livestock Subindex and Bloomberg Industrial Metals Subindex for assessing other commodities' indices.

	abstract = {This paper introduces an approach to the automated measurement and analysis of dairy cows using 3D point cloud technology. The integration of advanced sensing techniques enables the collection of non-intrusive, precise data, facilitating comprehensive monitoring of key parameters related to the health, well-being, and productivity of dairy cows. The proposed system employs 3D imaging sensors to capture detailed information about various parts of dairy cows, generating accurate, high-resolution point clouds. A robust automated algorithm has been developed to process these point clouds and extract relevant metrics such as dairy cow stature height, rump width, rump angle, and front teat length. Based on the measured data combined with expert assessments of dairy cows, the quality indices of dairy cows are automatically evaluated and extracted. By leveraging this technology, dairy farmers can gain real-time insights into the health status of individual cows and the overall herd. Additionally, the automated analysis facilitates efficient management practices and optimizes feeding strategies and resource allocation. The results of field trials and validation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the automated 3D point cloud approach in dairy farm environments. The errors between manually measured values of dairy cow height, rump angle, and front teat length, and those calculated by the auto-measurement algorithm were within 0.7 cm, with no observed exceedance of errors in comparison to manual measurements. This research contributes to the burgeoning field of precision livestock farming, offering a technological solution that not only enhances productivity but also aligns with contemporary standards for sustainable and ethical animal husbandry practices. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the rapid development and adoption of machine and deep learning (ML & DL) methodologies in agricultural systems, showcased by great successes in applications such as smart crop management, smart plant breeding, smart livestock farming, precision aquaculture farming, and agricultural robotics. However, these conventional ML/DL models have certain limitations: they heavily rely on large, costly-to-acquire labeled datasets for training, require specialized expertise for development and maintenance, and are mostly tailored for specific tasks, thus lacking generalizability. Recently, large pre-trained models, also known as foundation models (FMs), have demonstrated remarkable successes in language, vision, and decision-making tasks across various domains. These models are trained on a vast amount of data from multiple domains and modalities. Once trained, they can accomplish versatile tasks with just minor fine-tuning and minimal task-specific labeled data. Despite their proven effectiveness and huge potential, there has been little exploration of applying FMs to agriculture artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential of FMs in the field of smart agriculture. In particular, conceptual tools and technical background are presented to facilitate the understanding of the problem space and uncover new research directions in this field. To this end, recent FMs in the general computer science (CS) domain are reviewed, and the models are categorized into four categories: language FMs, vision FMs, multimodal FMs, and reinforcement learning FMs. Subsequently, the process of developing agriculture FMs (AFMs) is outlined and their potential applications in smart agriculture are discussed. In addition, the unique challenges and risks associated with developing AFMs are discussed, including model training, validation, and deployment. Through this study, the advancement of AI in agriculture is explored by introducing AFMs as a promising paradigm that can significantly mitigate the reliance on extensive labeled datasets and enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization of agricultural AI systems. To facilitate further research, a well-classified and actively updated list of papers on AFMs is organized and accessible at https://github.com/JiajiaLi04/Agriculture-Foundation-Models. © 2024},

	abstract = {Agricultural losses are caused by the challenges of severe climatic conditions and high levels of disease and pest infestation. The challenges in agriculture can be effectively addressed through extensive applications of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence technologies across the value chain of agriculture, from the farm to the consumer. This includes the integration of satellite and drone technologies in the field of Remote Sensing. Farms that grow crops, manage aquaculture, and raise livestock are adopting IoT and AI technologies. But growing microalgae, which demands careful monitoring, control, as well as prediction of biomass growth, has not yet been fully integrated with IoT and AI technologies due to its early stage of development. Therefore, this incorporation of IoT and AI in microalgae cultivation is estimated that make a meaningful contribution to the growth of the current microalgal industry worldwide. The purpose of this article is to give an idea of the state of microalgae biomass and its Inclusion with IoT for the future of intelligent agriculture.

	abstract = {This article explores the history of artificial insemination (AI) in order to suggest the value of writing histories of human intervention in animal reproduction in Latin America/Caribbean. Writing histories of how people have tried to direct animal reproduction is important for understanding changes in biological diversity and also for exploring intimate relations between people and animals beyond killing. Stories of human attempts to inseminate animals have circulated for centuries, but institutional programs emerged at the end of the nineteenth century and expanded greatly in the mid-twentieth century. After an early focus on horses, practitioners of AI shifted to livestock including dairy cows and sheep. In Latin America, as elsewhere, livestock owners and government agencies viewed AI as a means to boost yields of food and fibers via the efficient transfer of desirable genetic traits across generations of livestock. The extraction and storage of semen enabled ranchers to inseminate female livestock with sperm from “pedigree” bulls or rams that they did not own or that were even deceased. The diffusion of AI relied on inexpensive technologies and new forms of cooperation and communication between people and animals. In the late twentieth century, conservation biologists turned to AI as a means to reproduce captive populations of endangered or threatened species. The history of AI therefore allows us to cross the dividing line between “domesticated” and “wild” animals. © 2024 Centro Universitario de Anapolis. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In pig production, the number of pigs raised on each farm is increasing, but the population of workers involved in pig production is decreasing, so lighter labor is expected. On the other hand, it is also important to improve pig grading and profitability. Weight is a major criterion for pig grading. Too heavy or too light will decrease profits, and pigs need to be shipped at the appropriate weight. However, since each pig weighs more than 100 kg, weighing each pig is very labor-intensive. In large farms, more than 50 pigs are kept in a single piggery, and they are shipped together at the same time, after determining the day when they have reached the proper weight for shipment. In order to improve profitability, it is important to control the growth of pigs in a piggery so that they grow uniformly and to determine the appropriate shipping date. In this study, a prototype system was developed to automatically measure daily weight distribution. If the weight distribution in the piggery is known, appropriate shipping dates can be determined. This paper reports the results of a valid experiment using the developed system. © 2023, International Society of Artificial Life and Robotics (ISAROB).},

This article exhaustively examines the removals and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the agriculture industry. It also investigates an extensive range of GHG sources, including rice cultivation, enteric fermentation in livestock, and synthetic fertilisers and manure management. This research reveals the complex array of obstacles that are faced in the pursuit of reducing emissions and also investigates novel approaches to tackling them. This encompasses the implementation of monitoring systems powered by artificial intelligence, which have the capacity to fundamentally transform initiatives aimed at reducing emissions. Carbon capture technologies, another area investigated in this study, exhibit potential in further reducing GHGs. Sophisticated technologies, such as precision agriculture and the integration of renewable energy sources, can concurrently mitigate emissions and augment agricultural output. Conservation agriculture and agroforestry, among other sustainable agricultural practices, have the potential to facilitate emission reduction and enhance environmental stewardship. The paper emphasises the significance of financial incentives and policy frameworks that are conducive to the adoption of sustainable technologies and practices. This exhaustive evaluation provides a strategic plan for the agriculture industry to become more environmentally conscious and sustainable.

	abstract = {From connected sensors in soils, on animals or crops, and on drones, to various software and services that are available, “smart” technologies are changing the way farming is carried out. These technologies allow producers to look beyond what the eye can see by collecting non-traditional data and then using analytics tools to improve both food sustainability and profitability. “Smart Agriculture/farming” (SA) or “Digital Agriculture” (DA), often used interchangeably, refer to precision agriculture that is thus connected in a network of sensing and acting. It is a concept that employs modern information technologies, precision climate information, and crop/livestock developmental information to connect production variables to increase the quantity and quality of agricultural and food products. This is achieved by measuring and analyzing variables accurately, feeding the information into the cloud from edge devices, extracting trends from the various data, and subsequently providing information back to the producer in a timely manner. Smart agriculture covers many disciplines, including biology, mechanical engineering, automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and information technology-digital platforms. Minimum standards have been proposed for stakeholders with the aim to move toward this highly anticipated and ever-changing revolution. These foundational standards encompass the following general categories, including precise articulation of objectives, and baseline standards for the Internet of Things (IoT), including network infrastructure (e.g., stable 4G or 5G networks or a wireless local area network (WLAN) are available to end users). To sum up, SA aims to improve production efficiency, enhance the quality and quantity of agricultural products, reduce costs, and improve the environmental footprint of the industry. SA’s ecosystem should be industry self-governed and collaboratively financed. SA stakeholders and end-users’ facilities should meet standard equipment requirements, such as sensor accuracy, end data collectors, relevant industry compliant software, and trusted data analytics. The SA user is willing to be part of the SA ecosystem. This short perspective aims to summarize digital/smart agriculture concept in plain language. © 2024 by the authors.},

The coping strategies assessed in this study are the diagnosis made using artificial intelligence (AI) which is important for early interventions. Response to LSD outbreaks is very relevant in order to keep the livestock sector responding favorably and to save on costs. MH-ELM and INV-ResNet-v2 were used for feature extraction for diagnosing LSD in calves with a success rate of 0.968. This increases the diagnostic capacity and virtually speeds up the time for the test and biopsy. This study shows how, through the use of advanced learning techniques, disease management could significantly benefit from the application of AI hence improving on response to diseases affecting agricultural production.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Insects are a promising source of high-quality protein, and the insect farming industry will lead to higher sustainability when it overcomes scaling up, cost effectiveness, and automation. In contrast to insect farming (raising and breeding insects as livestock), wild insect harvesting (collecting agricultural insect pests), may constitute a simple sustainable animal protein supplementation strategy. For wild harvest to be successful sufficient insect biomass needs to be collected while simultaneously avoiding the collection of nontarget insects. We assessed the performance of the USDA Biomass Harvest Trap (USDA-BHT) device to collect flying insect biomass and as a mosquito surveillance tool. The USDA-BHT device was compared to other suction traps commonly used for mosquito surveillance (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps, Encephalitis virus surveillance traps, and Biogents Sentinel traps). The insect biomass harvested in the USDA-BHT was statistically higher than the one harvested in the other traps, however the mosquito collections between traps were not statistically significantly different. The USDA-BHT collected some beneficial insects, although it was observed that their collection was minimized at night. These findings coupled with the fact that sorting time to separate the mosquitoes from the other collected insects was significantly longer for the USDA-BHT, indicate that the use of this device for insect biomass collection conflicts with its use as an efficient mosquito surveillance tool. Nevertheless, the device efficiently collected insect biomass, and thus can be used to generate an alternative protein source for animal feed. © 2024 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America.},

While significant attention has been directed towards these species, a notable absence of research remains on other livestock species. Certain breeds of sheep and goats have also been insufficiently studied, revealing critical gaps in knowledge regarding reproductive interventions across Morocco's diverse livestock population. Although advancements in artificial insemination (AI) have improved outcomes in sheep through techniques such as semen storage and ovulation induction, essential methods like oocyte and embryo conservation, as well as embryo transfer, have been largely overlooked in Moroccan livestock research. This review underscores the necessity for a more inclusive approach, advocating for broader research that encompasses a variety of breeds within sheep and goats, while also extending beyond these species to include other overlooked categories of livestock. Addressing these identified gaps presents an opportunity to deepen our understanding of reproductive interventions and emphasizes the importance of establishing a cryobank to preserve genetic diversity and ensure livestock resilience in the face of climate change challenges. Recommendations outlined in this review propose a strategic roadmap that prioritizes expanding research to include overlooked species and breeds, integrating techniques such as oocyte and embryo conservation, and emphasizing the importance of embryo transfer studies in advancing reproductive biotechnologies within the Moroccan livestock industry. © The authors, 2024.},

	abstract = {[Objective] Manual disinfection in large-scale sheep farm is laborious, time-consuming, and often results in incomplete coverage and inadequate disinfection. With the rapid development of the application of artificial intelligence and automation technology, the automatic navigation and spraying robot for livestock and poultry breeding, has become a research hotspot. To maintain shed hygiene and ensure sheep health, an automatic navigation and spraying robot was proposed for sheep sheds. [Methods] The automatic navigation and spraying robot was designed with a focus on three aspects: hardware, semantic segmentation model, and control algorithm. In terms of hardware, it consisted of a tracked chassis, cameras, and a collapsible spraying device. For the semantic segmentation model, enhancements were made to the lightweight semantic segmentation model ENet, including the addition of residual structures to prevent network degradation and the incorporation of a squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet) attention mechanism in the initialization module. This helped to capture global features when feature map resolution was high, addressing precision issues. The original 6-layer ENet network was reduced to 5 layers to balance the encoder and decoder. Drawing inspiration from dilated spatial pyramid pooling, a context convolution module (CCM) was introduced to improve scene understanding. A criss-cross attention (CCA) mechanism was adapted to acquire context global features of different scales without cascading, reducing information loss. This led to the development of a double attention enet (DAENet) semantic segmentation model was proposed to achieve real-time and accurate segmentation of sheep shed surfaces. Regarding control algorithms, a method was devised to address the robot's difficulty in controlling its direction at junctions. Lane recognition and lane center point identification algorithms were proposed to identify and mark navigation points during the robot's movement outside the sheep shed by simulating real roads. Two cameras were employed, and a camera switching algorithm was developed to enable seamless switching between them while also controlling the spraying device. Additionally, a novel offset and velocity calculation algorithm was proposed to control the speeds of the robot's left and right tracks, enabling control over the robot's movement, stopping, and turning. [Results and Discussions] The DAENet model achieved a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.945 3 in image segmentation tasks, meeting the required segmentation accuracy. During testing of the camera switching algorithm, it was observed that the time taken for the complete transition from camera to spraying device action does not exceed 15 seconds when road conditions changed. Testing of the center point and offset calculation algorithm revealed that, when processing multiple frames of video streams, the algorithm averages 0.04 to 0.055 per frame, achieving frame rates of 20 to 24 frames per second, meeting real-time operational requirements. In field experiments conducted in sheep farm, the robot successfully completed automatic navigation and spraying tasks in two sheds without colliding with roadside troughs. The deviation from the road and lane centerlines did not exceed 0.3 meters. Operating at a travel speed of 0.2 m/s, the liquid in the medicine tank was adequate to complete the spraying tasks for two sheds. Additionally, the time taken for the complete transition from camera to spraying device action did not exceed 15 when road conditions changed. The robot maintained an average frame rate of 22.4 frames per second during operation, meeting the experimental requirements for accurate and real-time information processing. Observation indicated that the spraying coverage rate of the robot exceeds 90%, meeting the experimental coverage requirements. [Conclusions] The proposed automatic navigation and spraying robot, based on the DAENet semantic segmentation model and center point recognition algorithm, combined with hardware design and control algorithms, achieves comprehensive disinfection within sheep sheds while ensuring safety and real-time operation. copyright © 2024.},

	abstract = {Acquiring phenotypic data from livestock constitutes a crucial yet cumbersome phase in the breeding process. Traditionally, obtaining livestock phenotypic data primarily involves manual, on-body measurement methods. This approach not only requires extensive labor but also induces stress on animals, which leads to potential economic losses. Presently, the integration of next-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI), visual processing, intelligent sensing, multimodal fusion processing, and robotic technology is increasingly prevalent in livestock farming. The advantages of these technologies lie in their rapidity and efficiency, coupled with their capability to acquire livestock data in a non-contact manner. Based on this, we provide a comprehensive summary and analysis of the primary advanced technologies employed in the non-contact acquisition of livestock phenotypic data. This review focuses on visual and AI-related techniques, including 3D reconstruction technology, body dimension acquisition techniques, and live animal weight estimation. We introduce the development of livestock 3D reconstruction technology and compare the methods of obtaining 3D point cloud data of livestock through RGB cameras, laser scanning, and 3D cameras. Subsequently, we explore body size calculation methods and compare the advantages and disadvantages of RGB image calculation methods and 3D point cloud body size calculation methods. Furthermore, we also compare and analyze weight estimation methods of linear regression and neural networks. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future trends of non-contact livestock phenotypic data acquisition. Through emerging technologies like next-generation AI and computer vision, the acquisition, analysis, and management of livestock phenotypic data are poised for rapid advancement. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The implementation of effective livestock management methods is crucial to optimize agricultural operations. However, conventional livestock sorting and data management approaches encounter several obstacles regarding precision, labor requirements, and financial implications. The process exhibits inefficiency, increased labor costs, and an elevated risk of zoonotic infections. Housing livestock in extensive groups might intensify the transmission of diseases and complicate the surveillance and management of diseased animals. This study attempted to develop a Low-Cost Livestock Sorting Information Management System (LC-LSIMS) using a dataset enriched with crucial metrics and curated images collected over 24 months with the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The design of edge-cloud computing facilitates the redistribution of computational resources, leading to enhanced computational speed. The LC-LSIMS would have a predictive module to assist agricultural practitioners in safeguarding their crops during flood occurrences. This module will empower farmers to proactively anticipate natural phenomena, including floods, during intense rainfall. LC-LSIMS presents a multi-level design plan that facilitates attaining the specified goals. The findings obtained from the execution of the implemented system demonstrate a sorting accuracy of 91.47%, computational speed of 27.42 frames per second (fps), labor cost reduction of 50.84%, production efficiency improvement of 29.59%, and an average reduction in data input errors of 37.59%. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

	abstract = {The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant threat to global food security, human health, and the future of livestock production. Higher rates of antimicrobial use in dairy farming and the sheer lack of new antimicrobials available for use focused attention on the question of how the dairy production sector contributed to the development of AMR and paved the path toward taking action to curtail it on the targeted type of farms. This paper aims to provide an introduction to a phenomenon that has gained considerable attention in the recent past due to its ever-increasing impact, the use of antimicrobial drugs, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) on dairy farms, and seeks to discuss the possibilities of approaches such as digital health monitoring and precision livestock farming. Using sensors, data, knowledge, automation, etc., digital health monitoring, as well as Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), is expected to enhance health control and minimize disease and antimicrobial usage. The work presents a literature review on the current status and trends of AMR in dairy farms, an understanding of the concept of digital health monitoring and PLF, and the presentation and usefulness of digital health monitoring and PLF in preventing AMR. The study also analyses the strengths and weaknesses of adopting and incorporating digital technologies and artificial intelligence for dairy farming and presents areas for further study and level of use. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {While user-centered design approaches stemming from the human-computer interaction (HCI) field have notably improved the welfare of companion, service, and zoo animals, their application in farm animal settings remains limited. This shortfall has catalyzed the emergence of animal-computer interaction (ACI), a discipline extending technology’s reach to a multispecies user base involving both animals and humans. Despite significant strides in other sectors, the adaptation of HCI and ACI (collectively HACI) to farm animal welfare—particularly for dairy cows, swine, and poultry—lags behind. Our paper explores the potential of HACI within precision livestock farming (PLF) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance individual animal welfare and address the unique challenges within these settings. It underscores the necessity of transitioning from productivity-focused to animal-centered farming methods, advocating for a paradigm shift that emphasizes welfare as integral to sustainable farming practices. Emphasizing the ‘One Welfare’ approach, this discussion highlights how integrating animal-centered technologies not only benefits farm animal health, productivity, and overall well-being but also aligns with broader societal, environmental, and economic benefits, considering the pressures farmers face. This perspective is based on insights from a one-day workshop held on June 24, 2024, which focused on advancing HACI technologies for farm animal welfare.

	abstract = {Lameness represents a major welfare and health problem for the dairy industry across all farming systems. Visual mobility scoring, although very useful, is labour-intensive and physically demanding, especially in large dairies, often leading to inconsistencies and inadequate uptake of the practice. Technological and computational advancements of artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of numerous automated solutions for livestock monitoring. The objective of this study was to review the automated systems using AI algorithms for lameness detection developed to-date. These systems rely on gait analysis using accelerometers, weighing platforms, acoustic analysis, radar sensors and computer vision technology. The lameness features of interest, the AI techniques used to process the data as well as the ground truth of lameness selected in each case are described. Measures of accuracy regarding correct classification of cows as lame or non-lame varied with most systems being able to classify cows with adequate reliability. Most studies used visual mobility scoring as the ground truth for comparison with only a few studies using the presence of specific foot pathologies. Given the capabilities of AI, and the benefits of early treatment of lameness, longitudinal studies to identify gait abnormalities using automated scores related to the early developmental stages of different foot pathologies are required. Farm-specific optimal thresholds for early intervention should then be identified to ameliorate cow health and welfare but also minimise unnecessary inspections. © 2024 The Authors},

This paper details the deployment of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), integrating Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and 4G/LTE technologies, to create an IoT solution for remotely monitoring environmental conditions in outdoor production environments. The system is designed to be deployed specifically in pastured poultry farming using mobile chicken coops, emphasizing a farming approach that prioritizes the well-being of the poultry by providing access to open fields with vegetation. The system captures parameters like temperature, relative humidity, and lighting levels through wireless sensor nodes in the open-field rearing structure. Captured data is stored locally in an IoT station within the wireless network and concurrently replicated to a remote cloud-based database via cellular data network. Long term environmental measurements of the mobile chicken coop can be analyzed through datasets generated for an Open Data web portal. The system deployment in a real-world production context enabled the observation and analysis of the behavior of the studied environmental parameters at 24-h intervals. These acquired values facilitate comparisons between the ideal environmental levels and the actual conditions experienced by the birds in the rearing space. This, in turn, can aid the decision-making process for implementing corrective measures, ultimately enhancing the welfare, and fostering healthy growth conditions for the animals. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Trimethoprim (TMP), functioning as a synergistic antibacterial agent, is utilized in diagnosing and treating diseases affecting livestock and poultry. Human consumption of the medication indirectly may lead to its drug accumulation in the body and increase drug resistance due to its prolonged metabolic duration in livestock and poultry, presenting significant health hazards. Most reported immunoassay techniques, such as ELISA and immunochromatographic assay (ICA), find it challenging to achieve the dual advantages of high sensitivity, simplicity of operation, and a wide detection range. Consequently, an open droplet microchannel-based magnetosensor for immunofluorometric assay (OMM-IFA) of trimethoprim was created, featuring a gel imager to provide a signal output derived from the highly specific antibody (Ab) targeting trimethoprim. The method exhibited high sensitivity in chicken and pork samples, with LODs of 0.300 and 0.017 ng/mL, respectively, and a wide linear range, covering trimethoprim’s total maximum residue limits (MRLs). Additionally, the spiked recoveries in chicken and pork specimens varied between 81.6% and 107.9%, maintaining an acceptable variation coefficient below 15%, aligning well with the findings from the ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) technique. The developed method achieved a much wider linear range of about 5 orders of magnitude of 10-2-103 levels with grayscale signals as the output signal, which exhibited high sensitivity, excellent applicability and simple operability based on magnetic automation. © 2024 American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {Soil health is pivotal to agricultural sustainability. Promoting and sustaining soil health management is challenging since it involves many interdependent components and steps and is an iterative process. Herein, the soil health cycle (SHC) is proposed as a soil health management cycle encompassing human dimensions, management practices, and their effects on soil health indicators (SHIs), leading to subsequent impacts on soil functions. The SHC provides a structure for an iterative testing of changes to improve soil health. A systematic review of research publications was also conducted using the Web of Science database supplemented by Elicit AI and Scopus API searches to determine the status of research reports connecting SHIs to soil function outcomes, a critical component in the SHC. The review focused on publications from 2000 to 2022 and highlighted that most soil health studies separately report the potential roles of soil health practices such as cover cropping, no-tillage or reduced tillage, crop rotation, and crop–livestock integration in improving SHIs or soil function outcomes such as productivity and sustainability. The confidence in the causality of improved SHIs due to practices can be increased by demonstrably linking them to soil function outcomes such as productivity, environmental quality, and profitability. Presenting such evidence might allow us to tease confounding factors apart and present and contextually recommend soil health practices. It will also affect the human dimension in the SHC through informed and beneficial policies and incentives. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Small ruminant farming is of socio-economic and environmental importance to many rural communities around the world. The SMARTER H2020 project aims to redefine genetic selection criteria to increase the sustainability of the sector. The objective of this study was to analyse the selection and breeding management practices of small ruminant producers and breeders, linked with socio-technical elements that shape them. The study is based on farm surveys using semi-structured interviews conducted in five countries (France, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Uruguay) across 272 producers and breeders of 13 sheep and goat breeds, and 15 breed × system combinations. The information was collected in four sections. The first and second sections dealt with general elements of structure and management of the system and the flock/herd. The third section focused on selection and breeding management practices: criteria for culling and replacement of females, selection criteria for males, use of estimated breeding values and global indexes, and preferences for indexing new traits to increase the sustainability of their system. The fourth section aimed to collect socio-technical information. We used a data abstraction method to standardise the representation of these data. A mixed data factor analysis followed by a hierarchical ascending classification allowed the characterisation of three profiles of selection and breeding management: (1) a profile of producers (n = 93) of small flocks/herds, with little knowledge or use of genetic selection and improvement tools (selection index, artificial insemination, performance recording); these farmers do not feel that new traits are needed to improve the sustainability of their system. (2) a profile of producers (n = 34) of multibreed flocks/herds that rely significantly on grazing; they are familiar with genetic tools, they currently use AI; they would like the indexes to include more health and robustness characteristics, to make their animals more resistant and to increase the sustainability of their system. And (3) a profile of producers or breeders (n = 145) of large flocks/herds, with specific culling criteria; these farmers are satisfied with the current indexes to maintain the sustainability of their system. These results are elements that can be used by private breeding companies and associations to support the evolution of selection objectives to increase the resilience of animals and to improve the sustainability of the small ruminant breeding systems. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Grasping and object manipulation have been considered key domains of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) since the beginning of automation, as they are the most common interactions between systems, or a system and its environment. As the demand for automation is spreading to increasingly complex fields of industry, smart tools with sensors and internal decision-making become necessities. CPS, such as robots and smart autonomous machinery, have been introduced in the meat industry in recent decades; however, the natural diversity of animals, potential anatomical disorders and soft, slippery animal tissues require the use of a wide range of sensors, software and intelligent tools. This paper presents the development of a smart robotic gripper for deployment in the meat industry. A comprehensive review of the available robotic grippers employed in the sector is presented along with the relevant recent research projects. Based on the identified needs, a new mechatronic design and early development process of the smart gripper is described. The integrated force sensing method based on strain measurement and magnetic encoders is described, including the adjacent laboratory and on-site tests. Furthermore, a combined slip detection system is presented, which relies on an optical flow-based image processing algorithm using the video feed of a built-in endoscopic camera. Basic user tests and application assessments are presented. © 2024 by the authors.},

It offers farmers greater control over existing processes, from crop placement to soil conditions to chemical use. On the other hand, applying precision livestock solutions to these expanding systems is a way to bring animals closer to producers and minimize waste and costs. In Europe, precision agriculture has emerged as a new way to help farmers increase the quantity and quality of agricultural production while using fewer inputs. The spatial and temporal variability in the application of PA and the implications of site-specific application are documented in this article. The objective of this review article is to provide an overview of the application of precision agriculture in Central European countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, Germany, and Hungary) identified through a systematic literature review (SLR). The analyses revealed that with the rapid development of automation in agriculture, the demand for skilled workers will continue to increase and technology will continue to open up new application areas as well as the development of new AgriTech startups in the future. Currently, there are farmers in Germany and the Czech Republic who are leaders in the use of these technologies. However, the application of precision agriculture requires further research to provide more accurate information and is an area that is constantly evolving. © 2024 The Authors},

The assurance of authentic product delivery hinges on the presence of a reliable, intelligent identification system. However, extant livestock identification methodologies, primarily relying on radio frequency identification (RFID) ear tags, are vulnerable to loss, failure, and cases of misidentification or improper substitution. This article introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled system to rectify these issues by leveraging deep learning facial recognition for cattle reidentification. It utilizes an integrated approach combining the Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) algorithm for cattle face detection and the Siamese neural network (SNN) for subsequent recognition. The system was rigorously tested on a prepared data set consisting of 2500 cattle face images, demonstrating an impressive accuracy of 95.13% when supplied with a single query image and a 20-image sample per cow from our data set. This system can be deployed across diverse environments, including farms, cargo areas, and sale yards, without necessitating model retraining. Furthermore, it can be fine-tuned to identify other farm animals, indicating its broad applicability.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Microsatellite markers (MS) have been widely used for parentage verification in most of the livestock species over the past decades mainly due to their high polymorphic information content. In the genomic era, the spread of genotype information as single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has raised the question to effectively use SNPs also for parentage testing. Despite the clear advantages of SNP panels in terms of cost, accuracy, and automation, the transition from MS to SNP markers for parentage verification is still very slow and, so far, only routinely applied in cattle. A major difficulty during this transition period is the need of SNP data for parents and offspring, which in most cases is not yet feasible due to the genotyping cost. To overcome the unavailability of same genotyping platform during the transition period, in this study we aimed to assess the feasibility of a MS imputation pipeline from SNPs in four native sheep dairy breeds: Comisana (N = 331), Massese (N = 210), Delle Langhe (N = 59) and Sarda (N = 1003). Those sheep were genotyped for 11 MS and with the Ovine SNP50 Bead Chip. Prior to imputation, a quality control (QC) was performed, and SNPs located within a window of 2 Mb from each MS were selected. The core of the developed pipeline was made up of three steps: (a) storing of both MS and SNP data in a Variant Call Format file, (b) masking MS information in a random sample of individuals (10%), (c) imputing masked MS based on non-missing individuals (90%) using an imputation program. The feasability of the proposed methodology was assessed also among different training − testing split ratio, population size, number of flanking SNPs as well as within and among breeds. The accuracy of the MS imputation was assessed based on the genotype concordance as well as at parentage verification level in a subset of animals in which assigned parents' MS were available. A total of 8 MS passed the QC, and 505 SNPs were located within the ±2 Mb window from each MS, with an average of 63 SNPs per MS. The results were encouraging since when excluding the worst imputed MS (OARAE129), and regardless on the analyses performed (within and across breeds) for all breeds, we achieved an overall concordance rate over 94%. In addition, on average, the imputed offspring MS resulted in equivalent parentage outcome in 94% of the cases when compared to verification using original MS, highlighting both the feasibility and the eventual practical advantage of using this imputation pipeline. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {The globalized and fiercely competitive nature of the international market has expanded the range of demands across all sectors of the agri-food business. The dairy business needs to adjust to the prevailing market conditions by enhancing resource efficiency, adopting environmentally sustainable practices, promoting transparency, and ensuring security. The Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing (EC), and deep learning play pivotal roles in facilitating these advancements as they enable the digitization of various components within the value chain. Solutions that depend on human observation via visual inspections are susceptible to delayed detection and potential human mistakes and need more scalability. The growing herd numbers raise a significant worry due to the potential negative impact on cow health and welfare, particularly about extended or undiscovered lameness. This condition has severe consequences for cows, eventually leading to a decline in milk output on the farm. To address this issue, an Integrated Approach to Dairy Farming (IA-DF) has been developed, which utilizes sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics methodologies using mobile applications to continuously monitor livestock and promptly detect instances of lameness in cattle. Initially, the VGG16 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, was used as the underlying architecture to extract the sequence of feature vectors associated with each video. This approach was adopted to circumvent the limitations of conventional feature engineering methods, which tend to be both time-consuming and labor-intensive with deep learning-based classification algorithms. IA-DF can extract semantic details from historical data in both forward and backward directions, hence enabling precise identification of fundamental behaviors shown by dairy cows. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

	abstract = {The increasing pressure to feed a growing population of humans for food security, with constantly changing food consumption behavior, as well as in recent light of livestock treatment and awareness for food sustainability both economically and ecologically, also due to the challenges of climate change, lead to challenges for the industries operating in the Agrifood Supply Chain (ASC). Recent technological strides in Data Analysis, Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have ushered in a digitized and intelligent era within the ASC, reshaping production quality, sustainability, and food longevity. However, the nascent stage of AI and ML methods within the ASC raises questions about their reliability, value, transparency, and understandability. The prevalent use of black box methods underscores the need for more explainable methodologies, as the opacity of current approaches restricts widespread applicability. This paper presents a State-of-the-Art Review of Explainable AI (XAI) and ML methods in the ASC, delving into operations spanning “Farm-to-Fork,” encompassing agriculture production, processes, quality assurance, tracking, warehousing, distribution, packaging, retailing, safety, and sustainability. The research identifies challenges and proposes research directions, offering researchers an overview of opportunities to implement XAI methods in the ASC. The exploration of coexisting problems and their solutions enhances our understanding of intelligent systems in the ASC, providing valuable insights for stakeholders’ decision-making processes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {In cattle, facial temperatures captured by infrared thermography provide useful information from physiological aspects for researchers and local practitioners. Traditional temperature collection requires massive manual operations on relevant software. Therefore, this paper aimed to propose a tool for automated temperature collection from cattle facial landmarks (i.e., eyes, muzzle, nostrils, ears, and horns). An improved UNet was designed by replacing the traditional convolutional layers in the decoder with Ghost modules and adding Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) modules. The improved model was trained on our open-source cattle infrared image dataset. The results show that Ghost modules reduced computational complexity and ECA modules further improved segmentation performance. The improved UNet outperformed other comparable models on the testing set, with the highest mean Intersection of Union of 80.76% and a slightly slower but still good inference speed of 32.7 frames per second. Further agreement analysis reveals small to negligible differences between the temperatures obtained automatically in the areas of eyes and ears and the ground truth. Collectively, this study demonstrates the capacity of the proposed method for automated facial temperature collection in cattle infrared images. Further modelling and correction with data collected in more complex conditions are required before it can be integrated into on-farm monitoring of animal health and welfare. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Historically, the accuracy of the disease diagnosis is determined by a person’s abilities, experiences and length of time spent. Due to the high level of expertise, time, and effort necessary to obtain an accurate diagnosis through manual inspection, inadequate early treatment could result in the rapid spread of the disease. As a result, there needs to be much focus on early-stage fish disease screening due to the rapid spread of infectious diseases in the vast fish system. This research focused specifically on Protozoan white spot disease, an infectious disease caused by Cryptocaryon irritans in saltwater considering the fact that the infection is contagious. Consequently, this research aims to create an intelligent system utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, namely GoogleNet to detect infected fish based on raw underwater images taken. 90% accuracy achieved showed that the innovation could ease the process of fish disease screening.

	abstract = {Modern livestock farming systems face the challenge of meeting the growing demand for dairy and meat products while ensuring the well-being of animals. Body Condition Scoring serves as a vital process for assessing the body reserves in animals, impacting their health, welfare, and productivity. However, traditional body condition score (BCS) evaluation methods via observation and palpation of specific anatomical regions are labor-intensive and subjective, hindering their widespread adoption. To address this issue, Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) techniques, particularly those involving Internet of Things (IoT) devices and artificial intelligence (AI), have emerged as promising solutions. In this work, we explore the use of AI, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automate the assessment of BCS in goats utilizing imagery data. Our model was trained on 5000 images illustrating the dorsal view of the backside of goats achieving an overall accuracy of 97.94 % which was the highest compared to other popular deep learning architectures from literature (e.g. VGG16, ResNet34, ResNet50, DenseNet, GoogleNet). The proposed custom CNN model for goat-specific BCS estimation overcomes the limitations of manual sketching, providing automatic region identification for BCS assessment. Moreover, it is a lightweight model specifically designed for seamless integration with IoT devices, allowing for efficient on-board processing via cameras. The model's pose-independent nature and adaptability to environmental constraints make it a valuable tool for efficient and sustainable goat farming. This research advances the application of AI as a precision livestock farming tool, contributing to the reinforcement of the animal welfare and productivity, and supporting evidence-based decision-making processes to increase farms' resilience. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Soybean in India is pivotal for its nutritional value and as livestock feed. Its cultivation faces challenges like pests, diseases, and adverse weather, impacting yields and farmer incomes. Sustainable soybean production can enhance farmer livelihoods and ensure long-term agricultural viability. Creating a digital twin of the crop which models how it matures under specific conditions and operations can be an effective way to understand the yield outputs and environmental impact. For a high-yielding soybean variety KDS 992 (Phule Durva), we present a digital twin based model for monitoring sustainability practices and crop health, validated with a field study over a Kharif (monsoon) season in India. Results showed that measured yield for the selected variety aligned well with the model's predicted yield. With organic practices, soil health improved with a net increase of 1.50 tCO2 e/ha in soil organic carbon (SOC). As a contrast, the model projected an SOC loss of 5.88 tCO2 e/ha with conventional practices. AI-driven models integrated with the framework detected and contained soybean stress timely, boosting crop health. We believe the integrated digital insights would assist in giving specific recommendations to farmers planting soybean in general and the variety in particular. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a critical global One Health concern, ensuing from unintentional and continuous exposure to antibiotics, as well as challenges in accurate contagion diagnostics. Addressing AMR requires a strategic approach that emphasizes early stage prevention through screening in clinical, environmental, farming, and livestock settings to identify nonvulnerable antimicrobial agents and the associated genes. Conventional AMR diagnostics, like antibiotic susceptibility testing, possess drawbacks, including high costs, time-consuming processes, and significant manpower requirements, underscoring the need for intelligent, prompt, and on-site diagnostic techniques. Nanoenabled artificial intelligence (AI)-supported smart optical biosensors present a potential solution by facilitating rapid point-of-care AMR detection with real-time, sensitive, and portable capabilities. This Review comprehensively explores various types of optical nanobiosensors, such as surface plasmon resonance sensors, whispering-gallery mode sensors, optical coherence tomography, interference reflection imaging sensors, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, microring resonance sensors, and optical tweezer biosensors, for AMR diagnostics. By harnessing the unique advantages of these nanoenabled smart biosensors, a revolutionary paradigm shift in AMR diagnostics can be achieved, characterized by rapid results, high sensitivity, portability, and integration with Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Moreover, nanoenabled optical biosensors enable personalized monitoring and on-site detection, significantly reducing turnaround time and eliminating the human resources needed for sample preservation and transportation. Their potential for holistic environmental surveillance further enhances monitoring capabilities in diverse settings, leading to improved modern-age healthcare practices and more effective management of antimicrobial treatments. Embracing these advanced diagnostic tools promises to bolster global healthcare capacity to combat AMR and safeguard One Health. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The agricultural industry is encountering exceptional difficulties due to shifts in the macroeconomic landscape, and the prospects of the livestock sub-sector could be more precise. The elimination of subsidy payments due to agricultural policy changes resulting from Brexit poses a significant threat to farmers' financial stability and overall well-being, jeopardizing their enterprises and lives. Farmers must pursue adaptive tactics to endure the consequences of evolving socio-political situations. This research investigates the capabilities of Dynamic Software Ecosystem (DSE) as an analytical tool in the context of managing livestock within the farming sub-sector. In Smart Farming, using the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain (BC) facilitates the monitoring of resources and ensures traceability across the value chain. This enables farmers to enhance their operational efficiency, disclose the source of their agricultural products, and assure customers about the output's caliber. This study introduces a platform that utilizes the IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and BC in Smart Farming settings. The Optimised Live Stock Management System (OLSMS) employs the Edge Computing Design to enable real-time monitoring of dairy animals and feed grain conditions. It guarantees the reliability and long-term viability of various production procedures. The efficiency of the Expert System is shown by its dependability rate of 92.3%, as determined by comparing its outcomes with those of a group of experts in raising livestock. The experimentation conducted on various scenarios has shown intriguing findings on implementing effective livestock management methods within certain environmental variables, such as weather and precipitation. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

	abstract = {These last years, the development of AI robots for agriculture, livestock farming and food processing industries is rapidly increasing. These robots are expected to help produce and deliver food more efficiently for a growing human population, but they also raise societal and ethical questions. As the type of questions raised by these AI robots in society have been rarely empirically explored, we engaged in four case studies focussing on four types of AI robots for agri-food ‘in the making’: manure collectors, weeding robots, harvesting robots and food processing robots which select and package fruits, vegetables and meats. Based on qualitative interviews with 33 experts engaged in the development or implementation of these four types of robots, this article provides a broad and varied exploration of the values that play a role in their evaluation and the ethical questions that they raise. Compared to the recently published literature reviews mapping the ethical questions related to AI robots in agri-food, we conclude that stakeholders in our case studies primarily adopt a relational perspective to the value of AI robots and to finding a solution to the ethical questions. Building on our findings we suggest it is best to seek a distribution of tasks between human beings and robots in agri-food, which helps to realize the most acceptable, good or just collaboration between them in food production or processing that contributes to realizing societal goals and help to respond to the 21 century challenges. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Livestock industry is a pivotal sector for providing food, work places and monetary support for Egyptian people. Besnoitia besnoiti and Neospora caninum are protozoan parasites that are responsible for significant economic losses in ruminants, particularly in cattle. Besnoitia besnoiti can cause fertility problems and a general loss in productivity, while N. caninum is a major cause of abortion and neonatal abnormalities in infected animals. There is little information on the existence of these protozoa in Egypt, thus we conducted this study to reveal the current situation in cattle (n = 264), sheep (n = 151), and goats (n = 25). Serum samples were collected from governorates of Cairo, Giza, and Beni Suef, representing the most densely populated regions in Egypt. Using commercial ELISAs, an overall estimation among all tested animals (n = 440) revealed 7.7%, 13.2%, and 0.9% as seropositive rates for B. besnoiti, N. caninum, and mixed infection, respectively. Animal species (cattle vs sheep vs goat) and age of cattle (less than vs >1 year old) were analyzed as risk factors for infection. Regarding B. besnoiti, the seroprevalence was significantly higher in cattle than in sheep and goats and in adult cattle than calves. For N. caninum infection, no significant differences were recorded, although the seropositive rates were higher in cattle, and in adult cattle. This study provides the first seroprevalence data for B. besnoiti in all surveyed animals in the regions included, and in sheep and goats from Egypt, and supports the current knowledge for the occurrence of N. caninum in Egypt. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

With the proliferation in demand for the automatic systems of pork production, the development of efficient and robust meat cutting algorithms are hot issues. The uncertain and dynamic nature of the online porcine belly cutting imposes a challenge for the robot to identify and cut efficiently and accurately. Based on the above challenges, an online porcine belly cutting method using 3D laser point cloud is proposed. Design/methodology/approach: The robotic cutting system is composed of an industrial robotic manipulator, customized tools, a laser sensor and a PC. Findings: Analysis of experimental results shows that by comparing with machine vision, laser sensor-based robot cutting has more advantages, and it can handle different carcass sizes. Originality/value: An image pyramid method is used for dimensionality reduction of the 3D laser point cloud. From a detailed analysis of the outward and inward cutting errors, the outward cutting error is the limiting condition for reducing the segments by segmentation algorithm. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper proposes a multi-demonstration human–robot skill transfer framework to address the flexible and generalized cutting of sheep hindquarters with complex 3D anatomy structures by imitating humans. To improve the generalization with meat sizes and demonstrations and extract target cutting behaviors, multi-demonstrations of cutting are encoded into low-dimension latent space through principal components analysis (PCA), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and Gaussian mixture regression (GMR). To improve the robotic cutting flexibility and the cutting behavior reproducing accuracy, this study combines a modified dynamic movement primitive (DMP) high-level behavior generator with the low-level joints admittance control (AC) through real-time inverse velocity (IV) kinematics solving and constructs the IVAC-DMP control module. The experimental results show that the maximum residual meat thickness in the sheep hindquarter cutting of sample 1 is 3.1 mm, and sample 2 is 3.8 mm. The residual rates of samples 1 and 2 are 5.6% and 4.8%. Both meet the requirements for sheep hindquarter separation. The proposed framework is advantageous for harvesting high-value meat products and providing a reference technique for robot skill learning in interaction tasks. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this research is to determine the optimal combination of media components and concentrations for improving single cell protein production using statistical methodologies, while also taking into consideration the economic feasibility of employing food waste as a media formulation. Further study includes the use of an artificial intelligence tool called Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the R programming language to analyze the data generated during the experimentation process, assisting in understanding the relationship between different variables and their effect on SCP production. Method: SCP-producing microorganisms were isolated from food scrap waste. The highest amount of SCP production with a greater microbial conversion efficiency was determined using ITS gene sequencing. This study focuses on optimizing the components of the food waste medium for SCP production using statistical techniques to identify the primary factors affecting media ingredients and their optimum concentrations. The One-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach followed by statistical optimization was used for maximizing the components of food waste medium. The model was then evaluated using an AI-driven SVM and compared to a conventional RSM for improved SCP production. Result: The results showed that Pichia occidentalis (NCBI Accession No: OP605590) was the most efficient at generating SCP, with a microbiological conversion efficiency of 97.27%. The production effectively rose after statistical optimization (25.75 g/L from 1.58 g/L). The selected strain's microbial conversion efficiency with the selected salad peel waste was found to be 94.04%. Following that, model validation using SVM against RSM revealed that SVM (R2 = 0.9972) performed better in data modeling than RSM (R2 = 0.8881). Conclusion: The finding assists in the advancement of a waste-to-protein valorization technique driven by yeast for forthcoming feed and food sources. The produced SCP can be utilized as a high-quality feed supplement for livestock and aquaculture, enhancing nutrient intake and promoting healthy growth while also contributing to food security and decreasing reliance on traditional protein sources.

	abstract = {As climate change continues to pose significant challenges worldwide, regions of high vulnerability necessitate specialized strategies for effective resource management and communication. We examine the innovative incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics (DA) in establishing advanced early warning systems. Current advancements in AI have not only contributed to reducing climate vulnerability by identifying, monitoring, and predicting climate change impacts, particularly in zones prone to heightened climatic disruptions, but also helped prevent loss of human lives, livestock, agricultural produce, and other Earth resources. This chapter highlights the potential of AI&DA to transform our capacity to anticipate and respond to climate-induced resource shortages and disasters. The importance of these technologies in furthering educational initiatives, effective communication, enabling timely information dissemination, and coordinating responses in high-risk regions are emphasized. The potential of AI to serve as a “Technology for Social Good” is presented, emphasizing the need for accessibility, inclusivity, and multilingual support. The chapter also probes the role of AI in science communication by providing essential climate information and education, enabling individuals to make informed decisions and participate actively in climate action. The discussion extends to the utilization of AI&DA in Earth resource management (ERM), exploring ways to make these technologies interactive, accessible, and beneficial for the public. This chapter takes a novel approach with regard to how components of communication can help strategies during crisis situations with the model named as 3M (mistake+manage+mitigate). The 3M model examines the earlier assessment of managing risk communication and adds a communication component to it for better reach. Most of these earlier models were developed with respect to crises or from the perspective of specific communities in developed economies. To fill this gap the current discussion takes a holistic view of the problem and takes a communicative approach to deal with it effectively.

	abstract = {Glyphosate (GLY) is a widely used broad-spectrum herbicide, and ivermectin (IVM) is a commonly used antiparasitic in livestock farming. Both substances can be found in water bodies from agricultural areas and can have negative impacts on ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the lethal and sublethal toxicity individually and in combination of a glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) and an ivermectin commercial formulation (ICF). Groups of 10 larvae were exposed for 504 h, in triplicate to a concentration gradient of the commercial formulation of glyphosate and ivermectin, individually, and to a series of dilutions of a non-equitoxic mixture of both compounds based on environmental concentrations. Additionally, biomarkers of oxidative stress (catalase, glutathione S-transferase, and reduced glutathione) and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) were evaluated at sublethal and environmental concentrations of ivermectin (0.00125 mg/L) and glyphosate (0.7 mg/L) individually and in mixture. The ICF (LC50-504h: 0.047 mg ai IVM/L) was more toxic to larvae than the GBH (LC50-504h: 24.73 mg ae GLY/L). In terms of lethality, exposure to the mixture was synergistic at all exposure times. Both compounds separately caused alterations in the biomarkers of oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Regarding sublethal effects in organisms exposed to the mixture, potentiation was observed in acetylcholinesterase. The simultaneous exposure to both substances in water bodies can have synergistic and negative effects on aquatic organisms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There is growing recognition of the significant role food production animals play in the dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. This issue is particularly relevant in the realm of food production, where the administration of antibiotics of importance to human health to animals can foster the emergence of resistant bacterial strains that may be transmitted to humans through the food supply chain. Further, resistance can develop to antibiotics of importance for animal health which can create health and productivity issues. Cross-sectional surveys of Australian food animal production systems have revealed that very low levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are present in key bacterial species. Expansion of AMR surveillance in food production systems is, however, needed to improve the detection sensitivity of emerging resistances of importance to human and animal health. Scalable high throughput technologies, such as the robotic antimicrobial susceptibility platform (RASP), represents a step-fold change in the capacity to accurately detect AMR. Enhanced surveillance along with improved biosecurity, industry engagement and antimicrobial stewardship will contribute to maintaining low levels of AMR in Australia’s food production systems. © 2024 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).},

It also assigns a unique identification to each cattle relying on their muzzle point recognition system using YOLOv8. This allows for precise tracking and management of individual cattle. The system also provides similarity comparisons, enabling users to compare input cattle images with the database of known cattle. It uses advanced image recognition techniques to measure the similarity and identify specific cattle. The system can also retrieve specific information about the identified cattle, which is useful for livestock management, insurance claim assessments, and health-related purposes. The system has real-time capabilities and can be deployed in various agricultural settings, farms, and insurance companies. It aims to transform cattle management practices, improve productivity and animal welfare, and address healthcare and insurance-related issues.

	abstract = {The goal of this work has been the development of a deep-learning model which may be used in conjunction with a novel so-called “Meat Factory Cell” platform, namely to enable an industrial robot within the system to identify and successfully grip the limbs of an entire pig carcass. The model consists of three main components: (1) a U-Net-based deep learning model that predicts heatmaps with a probability distribution of gripping and key point locations on the limbs, within RGB-D images; (2) a post-processing element for the extraction of keypoints from heatmaps, and transferral of these points into 3D space using a pinhole camera model; and (3) gripper orientation estimation, which uses the predicted limb key points to define gripper orientation in 3D space. The proposed system demonstrates high precision and robustness in estimating gripping points on pig limbs based on a data test set, which includes two gripping definitions: Norwegian and Danish. These gripping definitions account for variation in the slaughter process in two different European countries. The Norwegian definition gives mAP(0.5…0.95) = 0.971, mAR(0.5…0.95) = 0.982, and distance error 13 mm, while the Danish definition gives mAP(0.5…0.95) = 0.985, mAR(0.5…0.95) = 0.995, and distance error 14 mm. The model was validated in practice during experimental trials at the Meat Factory Cell test facility at the Norwegian University of Life Science (Ås, Norway), with whole pig carcasses (n=25). © 2024 The Authors},

As traditional identification processes require trained manual labor that can be costly in resources and time, there is a need for more efficient solutions. Leveraging high-resolution aerial imagery, advanced computer vision techniques are applied to automate the identification process of deer across two distinct projects in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first project, Pantano Project, involves the marsh deer in the Paraná Delta, while the second, WiMoBo, focuses on the Pampas deer in Campos del Tuyú National Park. A tailored algorithm was developed using the YOLO framework, trained on extensive datasets compiled from UAV-captured images. The findings demonstrate that the algorithm effectively identifies marsh deer with a high degree of accuracy and provides initial insights into its applicability to Pampas deer, albeit with noted limitations. This study not only supports ongoing conservation efforts but also highlights the potential of integrating AI with UAV technology to enhance wildlife monitoring and management practices. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the current era of rapid online information growth, distinguishing facts from sensationalized or fake content is a major challenge. Here, we explore the potential of large language models as a tool to fact-check fake news and sensationalized content about animals. We queried the most popular large language models (ChatGPT 3.5 and 4, and Microsoft Bing), asking them to quantify the likelihood of 14 wildlife groups, often portrayed as dangerous or sensationalized, killing humans or livestock. We then compared these scores with the “real” risk obtained from relevant literature and/or expert opinion. We found a positive relationship between the likelihood risk score obtained from large language models and the “real” risk. This indicates the promising potential of large language models in fact-checking information about commonly misrepresented and widely feared animals, including jellyfish, wasps, spiders, vultures, and various large carnivores. Our analysis underscores the crucial role of large language models in dispelling wildlife myths, helping to mitigate human–wildlife conflicts, shaping a more just and harmonious coexistence, and ultimately aiding biological conservation. © 2024 The Author(s).

Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 1805 images with varying lighting, distances, and object numbers, reveal that U-Net achieves the highest Dice coefficient (0.95128) for segmentation accuracy. We further demonstrate the potential of these models for classifying individual birds as alive or dead, with U-Net reaching a classification accuracy of 88.938%.

The study assessed the extent of adoption of dairy farming practices and production performance of milch cows based on the primary data collected from a field survey of 200 dairy farmers in U.T. of Puducherry. There was wide scale adoption for health care practices like FMD vaccination, deworming, ecto-parasitic control measures and breeding practices like AI. The feeding practices like use of mineral mixture, green fodder and compounded feed had low adoption rates. Awareness programmes on mineral mixture and feeding practices would enable farmers to get higher milk yield. Group farming for cultivation of green fodder in fallow lands and restoration of common grazing lands are suggested. In addition, training programs on green fodder cultivation with supply of high-yielding green fodder seeds/slips by the State Agriculture Department to dairy farmers owning land would encourage them to take up fodder cultivation. The Government may provide feed subsidies for concentrates to help farmers increase milk production. Veterinary infrastructure may be strengthened to ensure availability of sex-sorted semen to dairy farmers to have female calves. Awareness programmes on hygienic milk production with emphasis on udder hygiene would help to prevent mastitis and avoid economic loss. Regardless of economic status, all the farmers should be made eligible to avail subsidy for livestock insurance. Milk procurement prices of Cooperative Milk Society may be increased to enable dairy farmers realize more profit. © 2024 Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.},

The precise estimation, recommendations, and performances are the main justifications for using technology. The knowledge that can be gained from animal detection and tracking in videos is useful for monitoring body condition, calving processes, behavior analysis, and individual identification. Accurate animal identification is necessary for monitoring animal welfare, disease prevention, vaccination administration, production supply, and ownership management. In this study, a deep learning-based camera tracking system has been built for businesses where animal welfare is a priority. For this purpose, images of camels in their natural habitat were taken in order to create a dataset. The dataset was split into three categories: training, validation, and testing. It contains 19,081 records from 18 different camels. To identify specific camel faces, this study used deep learning algorithms. The EfficientNetV2B0 algorithm had the highest test accuracy, scoring 98.85% with a validation accuracy of 98.53%. The AI for the camel face recognition task has been validated. The usability of AI on the camel face recognition task was successful in terms of recognition accuracy, and it can be used in place of conventional methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In pig breeding, environmental challenges can affect the welfare and productivity of animals. Resilient animals have the capacity to be minimally affected by these environmental challenges. Understanding the genetic basis of sensitivity to these environmental challenges is crucial for selecting more resilient animals, thereby enhancing welfare and productivity. The aims of this study were to 1) estimate the probability of the occurrence of an unrecorded environmental challenge on a given day using daily feed intake (DFI) data and 2) evaluate the genetic determinism of environmental sensitivity in three pig lines bred in real selection conditions. Data comprised of 100,799, 186,247, and 304,826 DFI records from 1,618, 2,517, and 3,788 Landrace (LA), Large White (LW), and Piétrain (PI) male pigs, respectively. The pedigree included 3,730, 5,649, and 9,293 animals for LA, LW, and PI, respectively. The probabilities of the occurrence of an unrecorded environmental challenge on a given day were estimated via a mixture model. The probabilities (p) of being "high coefficient of variation days"were then taken as reference and used in genetic analysis as an environmental descriptor to describe the environment. DFI records were analyzed using two linear models: a linear reaction norm animal model (RNAM) and the animal model. (Co)variance components were estimated using average-information restricted maximum likelihood (AI-REML). The means of the probabilities of the occurrence of an environmental challenge for LA, LW, and PI were 0.24, 0.10, and 0.22, respectively, indicating that the probability of an environmental challenge was low for most of the days. The genetic correlations between the intercept and the slope obtained from the RNAM for LA, LW, and PI were -0.52, 0.06, and -0.36, respectively. These findings suggest that selecting hypothetically for decreased DFI in nonstressful conditions would result in pigs with increased DFI in stressful conditions in the LA and PI lines, whereas it would have a minor impact on the environmental sensitivity of LW. The proportion of resilient animals for LA, LW, and PI was 75.0, 74.2, and 72.2%, respectively, implying that most of the animals were resilient. The study demonstrated that the slope of DFI is heritable and can effectively be used as an indicator of sensitivity to environmental challenges. These results are valuable in improving the resilience of livestock species to environmental challenges through genetic selection.  © 2024 The Author(s).

Precisely checking soil wellbeing patterns and anticipating future land appropriateness at nearby and worldwide scales are essential for illuminating feasible administration practices and strategy intercessions. This paper proposes a clever structure that use the force of large information investigation to address this test. We expect to overcome any issues between ranch level checking and worldwide experiences, engaging partners at each level to come to informed conclusions about land use and management. Our structure depends on the mix of assorted information sources. High-goal remote detecting information, including satellite symbolism and aeronautical photography, will give basic experiences into soil properties, crop conditions, and land the board rehearses. We will additionally improve the examination by consolidating promptly accessible open-access datasets on environment, soil overviews, and financial data. This exhaustive information combination approach permits us to catch the diverse idea of soil wellbeing and land reasonableness dynamics. Extracting significant experiences from these tremendous datasets requires clever examination devices. We will use a setup of AI procedures, including regulated and solo learning calculations, to reveal stowed away examples and connections inside the information. Directed learning will empower us to foster prescient models for soil wellbeing appraisal and land appropriateness planning, while solo learning will assist with recognizing remarkable attributes and likely peculiarities in various farming landscapes.The system will create constant soil wellbeing maps, featuring areas of corruption, supplement lacks, and potential improvement open doors. This enables ranchers to come to informed conclusions about manure application, water the board, and harvest choice, advancing their activities for expanded yield and long haul supportability. Moreover, our methodology conveys prescient models of land appropriateness, surveying the future capability of land for explicit yields under unique ecological circumstances. This urgent data illuminates policymakers in creating designated mediations, for example, protection programs and economical land the board rehearses, to guarantee long haul rural efficiency and biological system health. By conglomerating and dissecting information at a worldwide scale, our structure offers significant bits of knowledge into worldwide soil wellbeing patterns.

A comprehensive questionnaire was designed to collect specific information. For broiler production, more than 50% of farmers used the old version of housing systems. The results showed that 41, 33, and 52% of interviewed farmers received poor-quality chicks in Al-Hamdaniya, Bashiqa, and Telkaif, respectively. More than 50% of interviewed farmers reported high production costs due to poor feed quality, medicines, and vaccines and high feed cost. Also, the lack of governmental services and laboratories and the spread of diseases increased the mortality rates, negatively affecting production costs. For the local breeds production, the mortality varied between 15-31% and hen day from 17-33% among studied districts. The data revealed a lack of governmental or private services in most villages. More than 59% of farmers reported decreased sheep and cow numbers for sheep and cow production compared to the previous year. The reason for decreased large animals, as reported by above 55% of farmers, was feed price. the utilization rates of antibiotics were 98.4%, 77.3%, and 90.3% in Al-Hamdaniya, Bashiqa, and Telkaif, respectively. On the other hand, the antibiotic utilization rates in cows were 97.1%, 90.9%, and 66.7% in Al-Hamdaniya, Bashiqa, and Telkaif, respectively. The percentages of farmers who did not use AI for sheep and cows in Al-Hamdaniya, Bashiqa, and Telkaif were 96.8%, 77.3%, and 80.6%, 55.9%, 68.2%, and 66.7%, respectively. This study contributed to a better understanding of farmers' risks and the factors influencing their practices and decision-making in livestock farming. © (2023), (Elite Scientific Publications).

	abstract = {Amid the increasing challenges of climate change, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and erratic precipitation, it is imperative to devise adaptive strategies for livestock exposed to these environmental shifts. This study delves into the innovative use of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) to predict the effects of future climatic scenarios on cattle behavior using wearable sensor data. The pronounced impact of climate-induced heat stress on cattle significantly affects their behavior, health, welfare, and key factors such as performance and reproduction, ultimately influencing the quality and quantity of livestock products. Unlike conventional machine learning models, genAI's distinctive capability to generate synthetic data for anticipated environmental conditions offers insights into cattle behavior under extreme future climates. Our study begins with a comprehensive review of existing research on the impact of climate change on cattle behavior and the use of wearable sensor data, particularly accelerometer data, to predict cattle behavior. We then explore recent weather projections to set the context for our predictive modeling. Building on previous work utilizing genAI for synthetic sensor data generation, we introduce a two-stage approach for modeling the effects of climate change on cattle behavior. First, we create varied climatic scenarios and generate synthetic accelerometer data using genAI. Subsequently, utilizing the synthesized sensor data, we employ an appropriate AI model to predict cattle behavior under forecasted future environmental conditions. This innovative methodology underscores the potential of genAI in advancing predictive livestock management and climate adaptation strategies. By enabling farmers to proactively adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change, our research represents a significant step forward in agricultural systems engineering. © 2024 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

	abstract = {Agriculture has remained the spine of human sustenance on earth. Since times unknown, humans have learned and developed methods to produce food and other resources for their livelihood. Agriculture has seen large developments, especially in the last century. Scientific methods have accelerated the process of agriculture to a large extent. These developments have improved productivity by leaps and bounds. Though these developments come with a lot of benefits, they also include several demerits that adversely affect the soil, humans, and livestock. To retain and multiply the benefits contributed by this scientific development and to overcome the demerits and challenges faced in today’s agricultural practices, this paper aims at discussing methodologies that can be used to build an agricultural model that is much simpler and more efficient. The model aims at automation using IoT that could lead to minimized labor efforts by almost refraining human intervention in agricultural practices. Machine learning algorithms can be used for weather and soil-based crop detection for better productivity. The downside caused due to the use of synthetic chemicals can be overcome using organic methods. A web portal to facilitate direct producer-to-consumer retail can be deployed to curb the exploitation of farmers by the elimination of middlemen. Hence, the paper aims at developing an agricultural model based on IoT, machine learning, organic farming, and a web portal for direct producer-to-consumer retail. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {The Regional Pastoral Livelihood Resilience Project Community-Based Breeding Programme (CBBP) was designed with the objective of increasing production and productivity of local Zebu cattle by introducing Sahiwal bulls among sedentary and agro-pastoral livestock farmers. This study mapped out actors, their roles and level of influence in the CBBP as well as the opportunities and challenges encountered during its implementation using the Process Net-Map tool. The results revealed that there were differences in number and type of influential actors between sedentary and agro-pastoral livestock farmers. The bull host and subcounty veterinary officer were the most influential actors among the sedentary livestock farmers whereas it was the herdsman, bull host, and Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) among the agro-pastoral farmers. The CBBP was associated with benefits such as increased market value for cattle, reduced chances for cattle rustling, increased cattle productivity in terms of milk and beef production volumes and ease of access to veterinary services. In contrast, the challenges encountered were related to both governance (limited availability of veterinarians, cattle rustling, exclusion of farmers in the planning phase of the CBBP, political interference and failure of collective action) and bull management (high costs of keeping and maintaining the bulls in terms of feeding, housing, watering and veterinary care, heavy bulls injuring or breaking the small cows, sexually transmitted reproductive diseases among others). Lastly, this paper recommends adoption of a combination of well-organized and facilitated Artificial Insemination (AI) programmes alongside the improved bull service scheme as each has capacity to address the challenges of another.

	abstract = {Background This paper aims to improve the user experience of search filters when browsing products on online grocery shopping platforms to propose guiding principles for optimizing search filter designs based on food culture trends, product variations, and user preferences. Methods This study was conducted through a literature review, case studies, and quantitative/qualitative user surveys. Literature review was carried out to establish the direction of a filter design guide. Through the analysis of search filter cases in domestic and international food shopping malls, essential filters and specialized filters based on products and user types were identified. Based on them, a survey was conducted to extract key filters for each product. Contextual interviews were then conducted to derive insights and user types. Combining these findings, a food filter design guide and ideas were proposed. Results The guide for key filters by food category in online food shopping malls is as follows. Firstly, for processed foods, prioritize providing a [Brand] filter. Secondly, for refrigerated/frozen foods, prioritize offering a [Taste/Type] filter. Lastly, for fresh foods, prioritize providing an [Origin (Production Place)] filter, while agricultural and livestock products can share filters. Additionally, users’ behavior types in utilizing food product search tools are categorized into three: ‘Shopping Enthusiast’ prioritizes price and delivery date, ‘Stability Seeker’ considers quantity/price and expiration date, and ‘Homemaker’ focuses on taste preferences and reviews. Conclusions In this study, we identified the priorities of major food category search filters in online food shopping malls and proposed a food product search filter design guide that reflects user search behaviors. The research findings are expected to serve as crucial reference material for future design of food search AI algorithms.

The data is primarily used for descriptive and diagnostic analytics on the farm and statistical to develop the sector. The study aims to investigate whether the data could be used on farms in a more predictive manner. Five advanced algorithms were developed and included in a prototype. The prototype included algorithms to give an alert if a cow had a drop in milk or weight, algorithms trained to predict the need for treatments of ketosis and hoofs, and algorithms to alarm the farmer with an unexpected change in the total amount of milk, fat, protein, or somatic cells. The prototype was tested in 9 herds over 5 months. In the test, the algorithms were run each night on fresh data. The farmers received the results in an e-mail each morning. The prototype testing revealed that our algorithm on hoofs in practice had some difficulties hidden in the normal validation. The feedback from the farmers revealed, that the farmers had fixed routines using checklists in their management system. They did not change this for a 5-month prototyping test. The test showed that the farmers were curious about the prototype and compared the results with their normal system. The perception of the farmers was that the prototype picked up the same cows as their normal management system. Farmers also indicated that the prototype could be helpful to farmworkers with less experience. © 2024 11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Small-scale livestock farmers experience significant losses because of decreased productivity caused by decline in pasture production brought on by climate change. Technology in livestock farming introduced the idea of “smart farming,” which has simplified pasture management. Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics are just a few of the cutting-edge technology techniques that smart farming incorporates. Digital twin technology is proposed in this study to alleviate the challenge of changing weather patterns that affect pasture management. Digital twin model is developed to predict pasture height to ascertain the predicted amount of pasture and ensure that the sheep have access to enough food for sustainable production. Pasture growth is influenced by temperature, rainfall and soil moisture; thus, pasture height predictions depend on these factors. Digital twin is made of predictive models built on historical and real-time data collected from the IoT sensors and stored in ThingSpeak® cloud. Data analysis was performed in MATLAB® using the neural network algorithm and predictions of the system are modelled in SIMULINK® platform. Digital twin predicted the pasture height to be 52 cm while the observed reading was 56 cm. Therefore, with the prediction error of -4, the digital twin can serve to enhance pasture management through its capabilities and assist farmers in decision making. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as remote sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), computer vision, and data-driven modeling has become a hotspot in livestock farming that could facilitate animal monitoring, disease detection, feed optimization, and health management. This review includes an assessment of these topics and research done in Iran so far, proposing future steps for the deployment of AI-powered technologies in farm applications. The Iranian livestock sector already seeing benefits from AI advancements and information technologies, however, most studies focused on model development without applications or deployment for the industry. Significant work is needed to address the limitations and challenges namely lack of data, economic feasibility, ethical concerns, infrastructure issues, and regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, reported AI-based methods and approaches have some inconsistencies in Iran that hinder validation. Looking forward, AI could create a new era in the livestock sector of Iran that not only copes with upcoming challenges but also boosts the circular economy making this country a pioneer in the region. However, tackling some potential limitations accompanying AI application in the Iranian livestock sector warrants the multi-disciplinary collaboration of veterinarians, computer scientists, animal nutritionists, agri-engineers, and governmental organizations.  © 2024 Navid Ghavipanje et al., published by Sciendo.},

These advanced technologies find applications across various domains, including automated monitoring of crops and livestock, as well as predictive analytics for precision agriculture. However, the perspective and assessment of stakeholders on the adaption of these technologies to agriculture have not been evaluated. Hence, a survey with 145 stakeholders from Shonga farms in Nigeria to gather their perspectives on the implementation of AI and ML was conducted. By analyzing their responses across 11 factors, it was found that there is positive support for adopting AI/ML in areas such as training, infrastructure, productivity and economic outcomes. However, some shortcomings in terms of resources, policy frameworks, sustainability measures, and equitable access were identified. The variation in responses highlights the challenges related to training and infrastructure that need to be addressed. To fully unlock the potential of these technologies in improving productivity, sustainability, economic viability, and community well-being at Shonga farms targeted investments and policy improvements are necessary. This empirical evidence provides insights, for applying emerging technologies to promote sustainable rural development while ensuring inclusivity. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The increasing geographical spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) is of global concern due to the underlying zoonotic and pandemic potential of the virus and its economic impact. An integrated One Health model was developed to estimate the likelihood of Avian Influenza (AI) introduction and transmission in Cuba, which will help inform and strengthen risk-based surveillance activities. Materials and methods: The spatial resolution used for the model was the smallest administrative district (“Consejo Popular”). The model was parameterised for transmission from wild birds to poultry and pigs (commercial and backyard) and then to humans. The model includes parameters such as risk factors for the introduction and transmission of AI into Cuba, animal and human population densities; contact intensity and a transmission parameter (β). Results: Areas with a higher risk of AI transmission were identified for each species and type of production system. Some variability was observed in the distribution of areas estimated to have a higher probability of AI introduction and transmission. In particular, the south-western and eastern regions of Cuba were highlighted as areas with the highest risk of transmission. Discussion: These results are potentially useful for refining existing criteria for the selection of farms for active surveillance, which could improve the ability to detect positive cases. The model results could contribute to the design of an integrated One Health risk-based surveillance system for AI in Cuba. In addition, the model identified geographical regions of particular importance where resources could be targeted to strengthen biosecurity and early warning surveillance.

	abstract = {Nowadays, object detection is popularly used in most vision-based AI and it is sole to the various computer vision tasks like face recognition, Animal detection. This study focuses on the identification and tally of elephants using drone photos using YOLOv5. Drones allow you to span a vast area and facilitate prompt and effective animal monitoring. YOLOv5 is the first YOLO model to be written in PyTorch framework which is fast and accurate. As every species plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, extinction of one specie may cause damage to entire ecosystem. So, it is important to detect the endangered species and ensure their protection. In this project YOLO algorithm is used to detect and count the endangered species from drone images. In this project elephant is taken as a reference as the population of elephant is declining over several decades due to poaching and loss of habitat. Existing model only has detection of animal so counting of animal's feature is added to it to increase its efficiency. The model developed has mAP 89.4%, Precision 89.1% and Recall 83.2%. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {India is an agricultural country where farmers grow various types of crops on their agricultural lands using organic fertilizers. These fertilizers are provided by farm animals such as cows, bulls, goats, sheep, and many more. These animals also provide daily-need products like milk, fertilizer, and raw materials to industries, and help farmers improve their financial conditions. Due to these reasons, farmers raise these animals and take care of them. However, these animals face various problems in animal shelters, including wild animal attacks that kill them. To protect domestic animals from wild animal attacks, farmers use different methods like fencing, guard animals, and safe shelters, as well as eliminating food sources and making the property less attractive to predators. But despite these efforts, wild animal attacks on domestic animals still happen. Approximately 1000 domestic animals are killed by wild animal attacks every year. Therefore, a proper solution is required to address this problem by using artificial intelligence and IoT technology. This paper proposes a model to solve this problem using AI and IoT. The model detects wild animals near animal shelters and sends this information to farmers' smartphones. The model is deployed on Raspberry Pi and IoT sensors. Deep learning algorithms are used for wild animal detection and were developed using TensorFlow Lite. To alert the farmer in case any wild animals are detected near the animal shelters, Twilio API messages are sent to their mobile phones.  © 2024 IEEE.},

Unfortu-nately, due to the notorious logistics of industrial-focused large-scale underwater research, and the potential problems that introduces to state-of-the-art methods, only minor focus has been given by the robotics community. This paper aspires to increase the interest for aquaculture robotics, by exposing some major unique challenges this domain pose to relative localization and mapping. Robots are expected to operate in highly dynamic and uncertain environments with no static visual reference, absence of GNSS signals, and interference from a livestock of up to 200,000 units. With this goal in mind, we provide to the community a dataset11Link to our dataset: https://gitlab.sintef.no/aquaculture-data-sharing/rov. gathered from an industrial-scale fish farm, including monocular cameras, stereo cameras, and acoustics to promote further research. Furthermore, we apply three known state-of-the-art methodologies to demonstrate its value and experiment with different sensing modalities. The first method exploits the net pattern of fish cages to estimate the relative distance via Fourier transformation (FT) on frames collected with a monocular camera, the second method utilizes stereo vision for both acquiring disparity maps and relative pose estimation, and finally acoustic relative localization is shown with a 360° scanning sonar. The aforementioned contributions are accompanied with relevant analysis and discussion regarding feasibility and potential limitations in aquaculture robotics.

To induce the triboelectric effect, animal hair is then brought into contact with polytetrafluoroethylene which in turn has a high negative charge affinity. In our approach, the electrodes are built as an array of individual charge collecting pins, which protrude into and interweave with the animal hair and skin and act as the net charge collector. The generators are built with two different approaches: a) by using 3D-printed structures with miniature electrode arrays and b) by using conductive fabrics arranged in a specific laminated structure. These are then tested in the laboratory in interaction with different animal hair materials with a novel methodology based on using a robotic manipulator test bed. © 2024 SPIE.},

In dairy cattle farming, particular attention is paid to automatic cow detection and tracking, as such information is closely related to animal welfare and thus to possible health issues. Cows are highly social animals; therefore, a better comprehension of social context can help improve their management and welfare. In the field of Precision Livestock Farming, computer vision represents a suitable and non-invasive method for automatic cow detection and tracking. In this study, we developed and tested the reliability of a deep learning-based computer vision system for the automatic recognition of dairy cows in a barn equipped with Automatic Milking System.

	abstract = {Food insecurity is a pervasive phenomenon in Africa, and the paradox is that it affects farming households more than others. Although early and accurate detection of famine in farm households is a complex challenge, it remains very important to help reduce their vulnerability and inform policy and practice. Existing food security monitoring tools focus on isolated dimensions of the problem and some remain static. In this study, we focus on a composite metric of food security which combines three key indicators: Food Consumption Score (FCS), Livelihood Coping Strategies (LCS), and Food Expenditure Share (FES). We trained and tested various automatic classifications models, applied them to Burkina Faso's 2020 Permanent Agricultural Survey data to predict food security and validated our results with data from 2019. This prediction was compared to actual food security. The approach used correctly identifies the food security status of 84% of the households. Farms which practice agroecology are slightly less affected by food insecurity than those practicing conventional agriculture. We also find that households that implement integrated livestock-agriculture systems are less affected by food insecurity than households that do not. The proposed models can speedily predict food security status using multidimensional datasets and are able to identify the risk factors associated with predicted food insecurity trends, which is key to target priority areas for intervention by policymakers. They could also be integrated into data collection tools via server communication protocols to enable real-time monitoring.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The goals of this article are to outline meat science research priorities, examine the current state of funding, and bring attention to the need for science-based solutions and innovation that maintains competitiveness for meat products while also addressing the talent pipeline of scientists and development of a workforce. It is the product of a meeting of meat scientists across disciplines and species. The meat industry is a cornerstone to modern society and has significant economic importance, with a global worth exceeding $1 trillion. The U.S. meat industry generates over $239 billion in income, supports 1.7 million jobs, and contributes $41 billion in taxes, while benefitting developed and developing nations through robust global trade. Central to the meat industry’s success is the quality of meat products since consumers must have a desire to purchase and consume meat. Livestock and meat production face many challenges. Research efforts must continually increase efficiency, enhance sustainability, reduce climate impacts, address food security, and embrace artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and talent development. However, efforts to impact these areas must also consider downstream impacts on meat quality or risk erosion of consumer satisfaction and demand for meat products. Thus, meat quality should be a fundamental component of all research concerning livestock and meat production, including poultry, small ruminants, and fish/seafood. Despite its significance, there is a troubling trend of decreased public funding for meat quality research in the U.S., posing risks to this essential food source and the development of future scientists. This article provides an overview of meat quality research funding priorities aimed at supporting a sustainable future for meat production, emphasizing the potential implications if funding does not align with these priorities. Furthermore, it highlights the risks to the talent pipeline and global competitiveness if adequate attention is not directed towards these critical areas. © 2024 Calhoun, et al.},

	abstract = {The agricultural sector in Africa contributes significantly to the continent's GDP and plays a pivotal role in sustaining the livelihoods of its citizens. Although this is the case, it always faces one major challenge namely the use of traditional farming methods which ultimately leads to diminished yields, soil degradation, and so on. With the current advancement of AI, Africa still lags in incorporating such technology in the agricultural ecosystem. In response, this paper presents a novel approach based on Precision Farming aimed at leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to contribute to the agriculture sector in Africa. This approach introduces a dashboard powered by a range of advanced technologies for performing real-time crop and fertilizer recommendations, pest and disease prediction, as well as crop yield projection. Moreover, the platform is integrated with AgriGPT, a farmer assistant chatbot powered by AI language models to provide real-time guidance and decision-making support. By harnessing the transformative potential of AI in agriculture, this research seeks to empower African farmers, fortify food security, and combat the persistent threat of hunger and malnutrition.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the pregnancy rate of IACD and IATF in cows and heifers. Theoretical framework: Artificial insemination at a fixed time (IATF) and artificial insemination at detected heat (IACD) are essential tools in livestock farms, improving the production and reproduction of the herd in a short time, considering that differences sometimes occur between the pregnancy rate of cows and heifers with different treatments influencing the production of the herds. Methodology: 194 heifers and 200 Bos taurus x Bos indicus crossbred cows were used. The animals that entered IATF on a random day of the estrous cycle were synchronized with an intravaginal device of Progesterone and Estradiol. The animals that entered IACD were monitored. visual of the characteristic signs of heat twice a day for a period of two hours each, to carry out artificial insemination (AI), the statistical analysis was carried out with the help of the SAS software. Results and discussion: The pregnancy rate among the 215 heifers and cows in the IACD group was 64.00% and 44.00%, respectively, unlike the IATF group with a total of 179 animals, a pregnancy rate of 91.14% for heifers and 78.00% in cows, showing statistically significant differences in follicular size for cows and heifers under treatment with IACD and similar for IATF. Implications of the research: The cyclicity of heifers was efficiently induced in the hormonal protocols with IATF, this group of animals had a higher pregnancy rate and greater follicular diameter unlike the IACD group. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the understanding and effectiveness of using reproductive biotechnologies in livestock herds to increase production and profitability, thus being more sustainable. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

The nature of these changes however is subtle: between seasons seedlings sprout up and some flourish while others perish, meanwhile, over multiple seasons they experience fluctuating precipitation volumes and can be grazed by livestock. The nature of these conditioning variables makes it difficult for ecologists to quantify the efficacy of intervention techniques under study. To support these observation and intervention tasks, we develop RestoreBot: a mobile robotic platform designed for gathering data in degraded rangelands for the purpose of data collection and intervention in order to support revegetation. Over the course of multiple deployments, we outline the opportunities and challenges of autonomous data collection for revegetation and the importance of further effort in this area. Specifically, we identify that localization, mapping, data association, and terrain assessment remain open problems for deployment, but that recent advances in computer vision, sensing, and autonomy offer promising prospects for autonomous revegetation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {With the growth of AI and data modelling, the old saying by George Fuechsel regarding data quality ‘Garbage in, garbage out’ holds more truth than ever. Data Scientists are learning the quality of their models depends on the quality of data. Data used by the Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) is available to modellers around the world, and the quality of the data provided is important as it is used in modelling disease, greenhouse gas emissions, and more. These are important topics, so the data given to the modellers must be investigated and checked for internal and external inconsistencies. The goal of this paper is to investigate data provided by GBADs to find inconsistencies in the data. Data quality was analysed using a five-year trailing average comparison, the interquartile range for the yearly rates of change, and observing outliers on a normal distribution for the yearly rates of change for livestock populations over time. The normal distribution and interquartile range analysis is an internal data analysis that can find outliers that indicate possible data inconsistencies. The five-year trailing average helps identify external data inconsistencies between sources. Using purpose-built data analysis tools and performing analysis on the data shows there are inconsistencies in the data. The consequences of these findings show that researchers need to be cognisant of the data they are using and need to perform their own analysis before they use it in their models as the data can show incorrect results. © 2024 The Author(s).},

TAI protocols are based on synchronizing emergence of the wave of follicular growth, controlling circulating progesterone (P4) concentrations, stimulating the final growth of the follicle and inducing a synchronized ovulation. Hormonal alternatives that optimize the response at the end of the protocol and strategies to induce final follicle growth and ovulation in categories of females with low expression of estrus are described.

They have the ability to assist livestock owners in animal surveillance, which is becoming more important due to the growing concerns of consumers and legislative modifications in European Union (EU) member states on animal welfare and housing. Besides promising existing approaches, there is a gap in transferability from standardized scientific research to broader real-world scenarios. This research investigates the frameworks Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5 in terms of their performances to detect the sow and their piglets in different farrowing pen environments and recording settings. The aim was therefore to investigate what kind of setup and data can be used to gain generalized object detection models that can be implemented in different environments. Across all possible training-test environment combinations, Faster R-CNN had a higher mean F1-Score (0.83) and Recall (0.89) than YOLOv5 (0.77, 0.64). In terms of Precision, YOLOv5 (0.97) performed better than Faster R-CNN (0.78). The evaluation of the data from different environments showed that a combination of different environments and recording settings in the training dataset is best suited for gaining generic models.

	abstract = {The reproductive efficiency of livestock is crucial for agricultural productivity and economic sustainability. One critical factor in successful fertilization and the viability of offspring is the quality of semen. Poor semen quality, especially in frozen-thawed semen used in artificial insemination (AI) have been shown to influence conception outcomes, resulting a negative impact on livestock production. Recent advancements in genetic research have identified specific markers linked to semen quality traits in various livestock species, such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, buffalo, and equines. These genetic markers are essential in screening males for breeding suitability, which in turn enhances selective breeding programs. Understanding these markers is crucial for improving reproductive performance and increasing productivity in livestock populations. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the genetic markers associated with semen quality in key livestock. It explores the underlying genetic mechanisms and their practical implications in animal breeding and management. The review underscores the importance of integrating genetic insights into breeding strategies to optimize reproductive efficiency and ensure the sustainable development of livestock industries.

Drones and other names for unmanned aerial vehicles, have shown promise as a tool for wildlife monitoring and anti-poaching operations in recent years. Drone data can be analyzed to provide important insights into animal behavior, migration patterns, and habitat conditions, assisting in the development of more informed conservation strategies. Since the device does not hurt the species being attacked but rather causes discomfort that results in spontaneous pull it is technologically more sophisticated. In order to ensure that the volume patterns of successive frames remain coherent across time, the graph regularized is applied to them. Equipped with various navigation systems such as the GPS and optical flow, they are able to practically navigate itself thanks to today's fly-by-wire technique. Among the many possible uses for drones in tandem with other technology include soil inspections and satellite surveillance.

	abstract = {Livestock is a strategic part of the small-farm economy in Southeast Asia’s society, providing food income, clothing, fertilizer, and draught power. However, incidences or outbreaks of transboundary animal diseases (TADs) are due to converging factors such as the natural hazards’ aftermath, climate change, deforestation, urban growth, changing production conditions, and market chains. Therefore, this affects productivity and impacts farmers’ livelihoods with small holdings. The literature review was carried out to understand the current situation of TADs in Southeast Asia, identifying knowledge gaps to provide actions for disease control and prevention in the region. We have attempted to summarise the scientific literature in English on the prevalence data of TADs in Southeast Asia between 2011 and March 2022. Relatively few studies evaluated the distribution of TAD, where most of the studies focused on diseases that are important for international trade, such as avian influenza (AI), African swine fever (ASF), classical swine fever (CSF), foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and Newcastle disease (ND). Traditional production systems have received little attention in such studies as they belonged to mainly smallholders. The outbreaks of ASF and lumpy skin disease (LSD) in 2019 resulted in increased research activity between 2019-2022, while the other TADs were ignored in this period. For new emerging TADs diseases such as ASF and LSD, there is only information about the first detection without prevalence information. Therefore, further epidemiological investigations are necessary to reduce the gaps in disease surveillance reporting systems and support the prevention and reduction of further outbreaks. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This study aims to investigate the factors that influence the success of artificial insemination, the effect of successful artificial insemination on livestock rearing, and the income of beef cattle farmers in Palon Village, Jepon District, Blora Regency. The research method is quantitative descriptive with a survey approach. Primary data were obtained through direct observations, interviews, and questionnaires with beef cattle farmers in Palon Village and inseminators of the Food, Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries Office (DP4) of Blora Regency, while secondary data were obtained from DP4 and the Statistics Indonesia (BPS) of Blora Regency. Multiple linear regression and beef cattle farming analysis were used in this study. The findings show that the number of repeat breeding cases in Palon Village remains significantly high. Several factors were identified as influencing the success of artificial insemination, including female livestock characteristics, thawing and handling semen, breeder conditions, and inseminators' skills and attitudes. Livestock health, administration of anthelmintics and vitamins, rectal palpation examination, body condition score, age of the breeder, feed, and the origin or breed of the livestock are all important characteristics of female livestock. The handling and thawing of semen were discovered to be critical factors influencing the type of straw used. Farmer conditions, which include age, education level, length of time involved in beef cattle farming, basic livelihood, and the number of owners, also play a role. Age, experience in the field, and the extent of training received were discovered to influence the success of artificial insemination. Repeated mating contributes to increased maintenance costs and the costs associated with artificial insemination in beef cattle. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In India, many farmers face the arduous task of travelling long distances to livestock centres, incurring both time and financial costs, to check the weights of their goats. This challenge not only disrupts their daily routines but also has consequences for livestock management and overall agricultural productivity. In today's rapidly advancing technological land-scape, the integration of AI and computer vision algorithms presents an opportunity to address this issue effectively. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel architecture that leverages the power of AI and computer vision to determine body measurements and predict the body weight of goats.

	abstract = {Research on the influence of personality on cattle management is gaining interest in the scientific community. In the context of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), the Automatic Milking System (AMS) plays a key role, introducing a revolution in this field through intelligent process optimization to maximize efficiency and productivity. However, the biological mechanisms related to the animal's behavior and personality are poorly understood. This research investigates how boldness, a personality trait related to risk-taking, can affect heifers' habituation to the milking robot. Before calving, we investigated the behavioral reactions of twenty-three heifers alone in front of an unknown person (Individual Novel Human test- NHi), of a novel object (Individual Novel Object test- NOi), and another object while they stayed with other heifers (Group Novel Object test- NOg). Afterward, each heifer was video-recorded (focal sampling) during the automatic milking for the first ten milkings after parturition; videos were analyzed using the software BORIS©. Statistical analysis distinguished bold and shy subjects in each test and revealed that bold animals of NOi recorded less stepping rate (p<0.05) during the milking procedure, shy heifers of NH showed a higher kicking rate (p<0.05), while bold subjects of NOg spent less time in the robot (p<0.05) and fewer times pulled the teat cup off (p<0.05). These findings indicate that bold animals were less nervous during automatic milking, suggesting better habituation, and highlighting the importance of considering personality to improve welfare, precision, efficiency, and productivity. © 2024 11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Through IoT, various sensors and devices can accumulate real-time data on parameters like temperature, soil moisture, crop health, humidity, and livestock health. The collected data can be analyzed to provide actionable insights for farmers to make informed decisions. Precision agriculture is a key application of IoT in smart farming, where farmers can precisely observe and manage their crops and utilize their resources based on this real-time collected data. This includes optimizing the irrigation according to the moisture levels of the soil, optimizing fertilizer and pesticide usage based on crop health data, and monitoring weather conditions to predict risks. IoT can also enable livestock monitoring, allowing the farmers to remotely monitor the behavior and health of their livestock using sensors, thereby helping to prevent disease outbreaks and loss of livestock. Automation is another important aspect of IoT in smart farming, where various farming operations can be automated for increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This includes automated irrigation systems, autonomous drones for crop monitoring and pest control, and IoT-enabled farm machinery and equipment for remote monitoring and control. The paper presents various agricultural issues which can be resolved by using IoT and discusses the ways to improve the agricultural practices. These automation technologies can assist the farmers reduce manual labor, optimize the resource utilization, and improvise the overall farm management. © 2024 IEEE.},

The evolution of AI from basic pattern recognition to advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning frameworks signifies a transition toward data-driven agriculture. This analysis addresses notable challenges such as environmental variability, data collection difficulties, ethical considerations, and technological limitations. Furthermore, it compares various AI frameworks, highlighting their unique advantages and suitability in the dairy farming context. Despite these obstacles, facial recognition technology holds promise for enhancing farm efficiency, improving animal welfare, and promoting sustainable practices, underscoring the need for ongoing research and innovation. We advocate for future investigations focused on enhancing adaptability to diverse environments, ensuring ethical AI deployment, fostering compatibility across different breeds, and integrating with complementary agricultural technologies. Ultimately, this review underscores the transformative impact of AI in advancing dairy farming towards a data-centric future while prioritizing responsible agricultural practices. © 2024 The Author(s)},

However, this activity faces various challenges to ensure its proper development, such as cattle theft, known as rustling. This problem is what we seek to address with this project, which proposes a counting and monitoring system through aerial surveillance of livestock. Such results are achieved using images captured by a drone and further processed by an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. Remarkably, a key aspect of the project is the establishment of a database, collecting 1546 aerial images of livestock in 4 locations in Santander and Boyacá, Colombia. After rigorous labeling of the images, we proceeded to train the YoloV8m model. With the implementation of this model, we achieved an accuracy of 95.1%, precision of 96.1%, a sensitivity of 98.9%, and F1 metric of 97.47%. These results validate the model's ability to detect cows. © 2024 IEEE.},

Moreover, the increasing incidence of breast muscle abnormalities, such as White Striping (WS), Wooden Breast (WB), and Spaghetti Meat (SM), amplifies the urgency for tools capable of rapid and precise diagnosis of breast muscle development and morphology in broiler chickens. In response to this critical need, we present a novel deep learning-based automated image analysis workflow, combining Fiji (ImageJ) with Cellpose and MorphoLibJ plugins to provide automated diameter and cross-sectional area quantification for broiler breast muscle. Previous research in our lab has demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of this tool. Comparing the AI image analysis tool with manual analysis demonstrated an impressive accuracy rate of up to 99.91%, coupled with significantly enhanced speed and productivity. The automated workflow processed 70 times more data sets in 38-fold less time. The implementation of this method is intended to detect breast muscle myopathies (BMM) in broiler flocks at two weeks of age. We introduce a new concept of relative myofiber size, providing a unified metric and predictive threshold, showcasing a clear separation between moderate and severe myopathy broilers. This approach will enable early adjustment of poultry management, implementing preventive actions such as modifications of feeding programs and/or lighting regimen, to reduce growth rates, a factor known to be associated with increased myopathy prevalence. © 2024 11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

	abstract = {Success in Artificial Insemination (AI) is largely determined by the quality of the stored semen, therefore storage devices, especially straws or ampoules, are an important part that cannot be separated from the overall semen cryopreservation technology. Making a prototype of semen storage ampoules from nanocalcium silicophosphate biomaterials is based on the need for straws or ampoules. Semen storage in spermatozoa cryopreservation technology for the needs of AI and livestock breeding and from the results of an examination of previously patented inventions. The aim of this research was to determine the quality of simental cow sperm and the success of AI with the addition of nanocalcium phosphate to the Tris aminomethane egg yolk diluent using semen storage ampoules made from nanocalcium silicophosphate biomaterial. This research method uses laboratory research with a factorial Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consisting of 2 factors, namely the diluent factor consisting of 2 treatments (tris aminomethane egg yolk and tris aminomethane egg yolk + phosphate 1% w/v) and the shelf life factor. Consisting of 5 treatments (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 days). The second factor is the use of ampoules and without ampoules. Each treatment was repeated 10 times. The results of the research showed that the addition of nanocalcium phosphate to the egg yolk tris aminomethane diluent using semen storage ampoules made from nanocalcium silicophosphate biomaterial had a very significant effect (p<0.01) on motility, viability and abnormalities. Likewise, the AI results show the NRR, CR, and S/C values in the good category. This study concluded that the addition of phosphate to the egg yolk tris aminomethane diluent can increase the durability of semen for up to three days at room temperature and with storage at 5°C for up to 3-5 days, likewise, the results of artificial insemination success tests are also good and appropriate standard. © 2024 Enike Dwi Kusumawati, I Wayan Karyasa, Yogi Pratama Putra, Asmad Kari and Connie Fay Komilus.},

The health of cattle and the livelihoods of dependent people are seriously threatened by disease outbreaks, and a lack of veterinary care in a country where cattle are essential to rural economies. In order to improve illness diagnosis, individual cow tracking and food management, this research offers an integrated approach to the automation of cattle livestock management. First, using image processing techniques, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based system is built for the early diagnosis of lumpy illness in cattle populations. The work makes use of a 700-image collection from Lumpy Skin Image dataset. This approach makes it possible to quickly identify and isolate those that are ill, which reduces the amount of time the disease spreads through out the herd. Second, an RFID technology is used for a productive tracking and identification system is suggested that uses each cow's unique ID for tracking purpose. This makes it easier to identify and handle every animal in the herd. Furthermore, the system indicates resource usage and nutritional intake by monitoring and controlling feeding item quantities in real-time for cattle and livestock.  © 2024 IEEE.},

Automated systems with fuzzy logic allow the integration of expert knowledge from various contexts, facilitating the adoption of animal welfare practices. The objective of this study was to compare a fuzzy logic-based system model with a proportional control-based system model for regulating environmental conditions in pig pens. Through input variables such as temperature, relative air humidity and ammonia levels, the system output was the activation of fans/extractors and the opening/closing of curtains. MATLAB® software was used to model the systems and simulate actions to promote animal welfare. When comparing the efficiency of the fuzzy logic-based system with the proportional control system, it was observed that the output result of the fuzzy model was faster in 90.1% of the samples, with its average output in rpm being 12.7% higher than the proportional control system.

	abstract = {The global demand for meat is projected to rise, necessitating a transformative shift in the meat industry towards sustainable and emission-neutral production models. For decades, price competition has driven intense rivalry among meat packers, with a focus on cost control and product differentiation. However, anticipated increases in input costs and challenges to meat supply present a unique opportunity for innovation. Meat production faces mounting pressures, particularly in Northern Europe, to transition from traditional industrialized systems to sustainable practices that address climate impacts. Despite substantial investments in alternative proteins, livestock remains an efficient converter of low-value inputs into high-value human nutrition. As meat becomes scarcer, its historical status as a luxury food is poised to resurface, offering a business opportunity for meat packers while prompting Western consumers to adopt more plant-rich diets. Technological advancements such as automation and AI have revolutionized meat production, enabling efficient processes, enhanced meat quality, and reduced environmental impacts. The future of meat production hinges on adopting circular and emission-neutral practices. The industry’s sustainability will depend on balancing efficiency with ecological harmony, transforming meat from a ubiquitous commodity to a luxury symbol of quality. Through technological innovation and a paradigm shift in production philosophy, the meat industry can meet the nutritional needs of a growing global population while adhering to stringent environmental standards. © 2024 Hinrichsen and Støier.},

	abstract = {With the evolution of technology, advanced solutions have been introduced to enhance efficiency and productivity in various industries. As the agriculture sector is the major contributing sector to the Indian economy, it is then not a surprise that technology has had an immense effect on this sector too. One of these technologies is the Internet of Things (IoT), which has emerged as a transformative technology to revolutionize farming practices. This research paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the adoption of IoT by farmers in the agriculture sector, thereby focusing on its benefits, challenges, and implications in this sector. Various benefits like improved resource management, precision farming, real-time monitoring of crops and livestock, and enhanced automation of tasks which were the result of IoT adoption in agriculture, were thoroughly examined and analysed. These advantages contribute to increased yield, reduced costs, and sustainable agricultural practices. As implementation of technologies is not always easy there are various challenges associated with the adoption of IoT in agriculture. Moreover, agriculture is primarily in rural areas where lack of finance, technical know-how, and poor infrastructural network are major hindrances. The paper explores various factors such as high initial investment costs, lack of technical skills among farmers, concerns about data security and privacy, and the need for reliable network infrastructure in rural areas that affect the adoption of IoT in agriculture by farmers. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Maravanthe Beach has been witnessing erosion due to waves caused by tidal forces, destroying vegetation, and causing enormous damage to people’s lives, livestock, and property. Hence, an attempt has been made to understand the shoreline change analysis using the automatic shoreline extraction method and determine the rate of change in terms of erosion and accretion rate before and after the construction of coastal structures during the period from 2014 to 2023. The SWAT model was applied to analyze the influence of surface runoff on shoreline changes near Maravanthe Beach for the periods 2004–2014 and 2012–2023. Also, runoff was chosen as one of the parameters for validation of the analysis. It was noticed that the shoreline stretch had experienced significant erosion prior to the construction of shore protection infrastructure. Soon after the deployment of certain shore structures, the shoreline progressed from a high erosion stretch to a low erosion stretch. This study reveals that Maravanthe Beach witnessed greater erosion during the period 2014–2018 than it did from 2019–2023 and also observed a decrease in erosion from 11% to 3% and an increase in the accretion zones from 2 to 9%. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Water quality plays a pivotal role in agricultural productivity, with its impact reverberating across crop yield and livestock health. This research delves into the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) to unveil the intricate relationships between groundwater quality and agricultural outcomes. Leveraging a comprehensive methodology, we harnessed the power of AI techniques to predict groundwater quality classifications and elucidate their ramifications for farming practices. Our investigation commenced with meticulous data collection from the Telangana Open Data portal, culminating in a dataset spanning three years. Employing techniques such as median imputation and linear regression, we addressed missing values to ensure the integrity of our analysis. Subsequently, we engaged in normalization and dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to facilitate model training and interpretation. The predictive prowess of AI emerged through our evaluation of models, with the XGBoost classifier showcasing a mean cross-validation accuracy of 90.65%. Importantly, interpretability was enhanced by visualizations, including heatmaps and attribute correlations, which unveiled underlying patterns in water quality data. The practical significance of our work was revealed as the model's predictive capabilities translated into actionable insights for agricultural planning. Farmers can leverage AI-driven predictions to optimize crop selection and irrigation strategies, thereby mitigating potential yield losses. Acknowledging limitations and avenues for future research, this paper presents a compelling case for the application of AI in deciphering the water quality-agricultural productivity nexus. Through accurate predictions and actionable insights, we unveil a pathway towards sustainable agricultural practices informed by cutting-edge technology and scientific rigor.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robotic milking systems are successful innovations in the development of dairy cattle. The objective of this study was to analyse the milking characteristics and behavior of dairy cows of different calving orders in “milk first” robotic milking systems. The data were collected from a commercial herd located in the Midwest region of Minas Gerais (Brazil), which uses an automatic milking system (AMS™, DeLaval). Were analysed 26,574 observations of 235 Holstein cows were available. Data were evaluated by multivariate analysis of variance and the Tukey test.-Tthe characteristics milk flow and milking efficiency were more favourable for multiparous cows (p <0.01), while the time in the stall was more favourable for primiparous females (p <0.01). The values of handling time were better in the primiparous cows (p <0.01). Primiparous cows had higher amounts of kick-off (p <0.001), and multiparous cows had higher incomplete milkings (p <0.001). The number of incomplete milkings showed a higher ratio in terms of reduction in milk production in 26.6% in primiparous cows and 26.7% in multiparous cows (p <0.01). Regarding the behavioral characteristics, primiparous cows had higher amounts of kickbacks, while multiparous cows had greater quantities of incomplete milkings. © 2024, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

The utilization of modern poultry production systems with a high degree of concentration and automation has resulted in the health status of sensitive poultry strains and hybrids. Some humoral indicators of natural immunity in broiler chickens from the ROSS 308 hybrid and growing broiler breeders were studied. The experiment was conducted in control and experimental herds raised under the same production conditions. The experimental herds were reared without the use of antibiotics but were treated with the immunomodulator Avigen. The values of serum lysozyme concentrations, the alternative pathway of complement activity (APCA), and concentrations of IFN γ, IL-2, and IL-6 of broilers treated with Avigen significantly exceeded the values in the control birds. The same tendency is observed among the growing broiler breeders. Serum IgY concentrations show a significant difference in growing broiler breeders but not in broilers. Based on the obtained data, the treatment with the immunomodulator Avigen increases the natural resistance of birds, which allows them to be raised without the use of antibiotics in production conditions. © 2024, R Karakolev, Ts Koynarski, L Sotirov, R Petrova, P Petrova-Tsenin},

	abstract = {Dairy farmers and beef cattle breeders aim for one calf per year to optimize breeding efficiency, relying on artificial insemination of both dairy and beef cows. Accurate estrus detection and timely insemination are vital for improving conception rates. However, recent challenges such as operational expansion, increased livestock numbers, and heightened milk production have complicated these processes. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based pregnancy probability diagnostic tool to predict the optimal timing for artificial insemination. This tool analyzes external uterine opening image data through AI analysis, enabling high conception rates when inexperienced individuals conduct the procedure. In the initial experimental phase, images depicting the external uterine opening during artificial insemination were acquired for AI training. Static images were extracted from videos to create a pregnancy probability diagnostic model (PPDM). In the subsequent phase, an augmented set of images was introduced to enhance the precision of the PPDM. Additionally, a web application was developed for real-time assessment of optimal insemination timing, and its effectiveness in practical field settings was evaluated. The results indicated that when PPDM predicted a pregnancy probability of 70% or higher, it demonstrated a high level of reliability with accuracy, precision, and recall rates of 76.2%, 76.2%, and 100%, respectively, and an F-score of 0.86. This underscored the applicability and reliability of AI-based tools in predicting optimal insemination timing, potentially offering substantial benefits to breeding operations.

	abstract = {This research study suggests a new method to differentiate three commonly found species of mushrooms namely Button, Oyster, and Shiitake widely available in India, using CNN and GB models. With the help of the carefully selected dataset of around 9 thousand images of high resolution integrated methodology has yielded an astounding average accuracy of 93. 18%. CNN provided a very efficient features extraction for the complex visual patterns, while GB naturally dealt with additional features achieving accurate classification models. Using performance evaluation, a high precision, recall, and F1 score was achieved on all the mushroom classes meaning that the models were able to perform well in differentiating between different classes especially those which are unique from each other. Comparative analysis placed models as being more advantageous in comparison to the current techniques illustrated in Figure 3. Apart from their efficiency, these models can be easily implemented on a large scale and work in an autonomous manner, which has a vast impact on agriculture, food services, and medicine. Thus, the feature proves the effectiveness of CNNs and GB in precise classification of mushrooms for their further application in a variety of spheres. Further works could look at other, potentially larger data sets and at the integration of machine explicable AI methodologies to relate the facets of the models even more accurately and transparently. All in all, the study paves way for embracing an era that can potentially bring 'mushroom perfect' in classification for the varieties of mushrooms so that India can have new vistas for mushroom farming, culinary world and healthcare sector.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Commercial poultry production strives to create optimal conditions for bird growth, health and welfare. This requires an optimally controlled environment, currently based on monitoring temperature, humidity, CO2 and air pressure. Water and feed consumption are often used as a proxy for monitoring health and welfare. In addition, farm managers monitor flock health and welfare by observing behaviour. Current precision livestock farming (PLF) systems only monitor general flock behaviour such as movement or change of location of the broilers in the house. Improvements in Artificial intelligence (AI) imaging technology could make it possible to monitor other parameters related to animal welfare and health such as feeding, drinking and movement behaviour. Current at the time of the project, AI imaging technology (V7 Darwin platform), was used to test for classification of specific behaviours providing unbiased information relating to health and welfare of the flock was possible. A large data set comprising video recordings of behavioural patterns throughout the broiler growing cycle over several crops, enabled AI model training, built to visually differentiate between behaviours: feeding, drinking and wing flapping. Model training on the manually annotated image sequences gave a mean average precision (mAP) of 82.5% on average. Further behaviours such as resting, walking/running and wing flapping can be realistically identified using the same technology in the future. The next generation automated labelling technology using recently introduced segment anything models (SAM) as well as multimodal approaches with the integration of large language models (LLMs) will reduce annotating the time for experimentation, decreasing costs and improve time to market with better AI products. © 2024 11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

	abstract = {The robotic milking system (RMS) is unique in its ability to operate without human intervention. It allows cows to choose when and how often to be milked during the day, benefiting animal health and welfare. However, specific technical indicators for RMS incorporated into pasture-based production systems are still being established. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the feasibility of integrating robotic milking in a silvopastoral dairy production system with cows of different breeds. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Pecuária Sudeste, São Carlos, Brazil (22°01'S, 47°53'W, 860m), for 92 days. Sixty-six lactating cows of Holstein (HO, n=21), HJ crossbred (1/2 Holstein × 1/2 Jersey; HJ, n=24), and HX crossbred (≥3/4 Jersey on Holstein base; HX, n=21) breeds were observed. Cows were intensively grazed in a silvopastoral system with voluntary and unrestricted access to the RMS. Data from 9,305 milkings were analyzed (ANOVA; R-Studio; α=5%). HO and HJ cows had a higher daily milk yield than HX cows (P<0.05). The HO and HJ cows had a longer daily milking time (P<0.05), which was attributed to the higher daily production per animal. There was no significant difference in milking frequency between the genotypes (P>0.05). Daily milk yield, daily milking time, and milking frequency were positively and significantly correlated (P<0.0001). The results indicate that cows with higher milk yields have spent more time in the milking box. Furthermore, no evidence suggests that more productive cows visit the milking robot more frequently in a pasture-based system. © 2024 11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

	abstract = {In global food production, broiler chickens hold significant importance, which are traditionally managed through manual labour for both meat and egg production. However, the poultry farming industry has increasingly turned to automation to address challenges associated with manual labour and enhance efficiency. This research introduces a novel methodology for estimating chicken weight utilizing top-view videos as input and leveraging 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Accurate weight assessment is a critical aspect of poultry farming, influencing feeding strategies and resource allocation. Traditional manual weighing methods are laborious and time-intensive, necessitating the exploration of automated alternatives. The methodology involves dataset collection, preprocessing, and employing 3D CNNs for effective feature extraction. 3D CNN architecture, adept at capturing spatial and temporal features, consists of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by flatten and dense layers for weight prediction. The model achieves a remarkable accuracy of 95%, as evidenced in the experimental results. Experimental validation showcases the potential of this method as a non-invasive and efficient tool for estimating chicken weight. It contributes to the growing field of automated livestock management in agriculture.  © 2024 IEEE.},

However, precisely mimicking animal may cause discomfort, such as the uncanny valley effect. Therefore, the minimum factors of animals that can be mimicked by robotic devices and give a lifelike feeling of touching real animals should be clarified. We hypothesized that touching on a device that mimics the breathing of animals and showing a video of a live animal gives a feeling of touching live real animals and provides relaxation to the user. To prove this, we made a simple device mimicking animal breathing. We conducted a controlled experiment with 36 participants over 15 minutes using the device. We showed an animal video and asked participants to touch the breath-mimicking device. We measured subjects' moods using the Temporary Mood Scale and lifelikeness using the Godspeed scale. As a result, we found that the simultaneous experience of watching the animal video and touching a breathing device gives a better lifelike sensation of touching real animals than the cases of either experience.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the transformation and upgrading of traditional agriculture towards digitization and intelligence, improving agricultural efficiency and structural optimization. The agricultural environment is dynamic, with numerous factors affecting the growth of crops and livestock, as well as their complex relationships. It is a grand challenge to understand and explain smart agriculture. There are numerous models and frameworks proposed for smart agriculture. Some of the problems with the existing studies include: (1) a lack of unified model or framework for smart agriculture, (2) an overlook of the involvement of the most important elements of any agriculture, namely, smart people, and (3) an insufficient consideration of the crucial role of smart government in modern agriculture. In this paper, we propose a Machine-People-Government triangular model for smart agriculture (MPG4SA), emphasizing the roles of machines, human contributors, and government. We introduce a conceptual three-level framework based on the Symbols-Meaning-Value (SMV) space for smart agriculture named SMV4SA. This framework delineates the nine critical roles of machine, people, and government across three layers: data acquisition, knowledge discovery, and decision-making. The framework may provide conceptual and theoretical support for end-to-end smart agriculture applications such as pre-production planning, in-season management, crop disease and pest recognition, post-production management, and government policy making. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a triboelectric device for motion sensing or kinetic energy harvesting in precision livestock farming (PLF) wearables. Triboelectric kinetic energy harvesting has proven to be an attractive research topic in the past decade. Triboelectric effect occurs when two dielectric materials - the triboelectric pair - found on the opposite sides of the so-called triboelectric spectrum, are brought into contact. During contact, a charge separation occurs which causes a voltage potential between the electrodes deposited on the materials. In our research we found that animal hair is in fact a perfect triboelectric material with high positive charge affinity. If animal hair is brought into contact with a suitable negative affinity charge material like Polytetrafluoroethylene - a strong charge separation occurs. In our research we've discovered a way to establish charge separation at discrete points on the animal skin or inside the animal hair layer by using a specifically designed array of charge collecting electrodes. Two different manufacturing techniques are tested: a) 3D printing with animal compatible and b) laminating conductive fabrics. The resulting devices are then tested in the lab by employing robotic manipulators under different loading conditions and with different animal hair samples - cattle, sheep & reindeer. The devices presented in this paper could in the future result with low-cost alternatives to accelerometers or could be used to develop self-powered collars for PLF applications. © 2024 11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

There is significant variation within different livestock management systems globally but the majority of the operations are carried out manually all over the world. Mechanization of livestock farms is imperative to enhance production along with labor management. Mechanization can be implied at various levels, i.e., milking, feeding, waste management, animal monitoring as well as fodder production. Robotic milking system (RMS) adoption on dairy farms results in 20%–50% labor savings. Total mixed ration (TMR) mixers and mobile feeding systems aid in precise nutrient assessment and feed distribution with lower anthropoid efforts. Animal waste can be handled with a green approach by Solid–liquid separators and aerobic fermentation tanks, etc. Accelerometer and radio frequency identification (RFID) devices track the animal locale and health status without much additional support. Small farm holdings, huge installation cost, and lack of maintenance amenities are the major constrains in the widespread acceptance of farm mechanization which can be endeavored by pertinent strategies and digitalization. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Pig detection technology is of paramount importance in modern livestock farming, especially within large-scale breeding environments. It not only significantly enhances breeding efficiency by optimizing feeding strategies through real-time monitoring of the pigs' health and growth status but also substantially reduces the risk of disease transmission, yielding notable economic benefits for farmers. With the livestock industry's shift towards automation and intelligence, the demand for more accurate and efficient pig detection technologies has been growing. Among the technologies employed, the YOLO series of models are frequently utilized for pig detection. However, the natural variety in the postures and forms of pigs can lead to recognition issues with some postures using standard models. Therefore, this paper introduces a Deformable Attention module to the YOLOv8 model, which not only captures more global information but also effectively addresses the issue of target deformability. By adaptively adjusting the shape of the convolutional kernels, the module enhances the capture of target features. Experimental results show that the improved model detects pigs more accurately than the original YOLOv8n model and achieves a 3.2% increase in the mAP50-95 metric. © 2024 SPIE.},

Nevertheless, the industry grapples with significant challenges, including disease, climate change, and population growth. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a potential solution to these challenges by enhancing the precision and efficiency of cattle management practices. This proposed system leverages AI, utilizing the state-of-the-art InceptionResNetV2 architecture within a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, to accurately differentiate between cows and buffaloes. In addition to cattle identification, it has the capacity to expand its scope to include cattle healthcare and insurance claim assessment. The system relies on a dataset containing high-resolution images of cattle from diverse regions and environments for training and validation. By fine-tuning and optimizing the InceptionResNetV2 architecture, recognized for its excellence in image classification tasks, the system becomes an invaluable tool for livestock management. Notably, this AI-driven cattle identification and healthcare assessment system possesses real-time capabilities, rendering it suitable for deployment in agricultural settings, farms, and insurance companies. The proposed system has the potential to significantly improve livestock management, thereby enhancing productivity and animal welfare, while also addressing healthcare and insurance-related aspects. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is one of the most promising applications showing the benefits of using drones, where a lack of the human element in the farming industry is becoming evident. UAV-assisted smart farming has gained momentum in managing large farms effectively, by avoiding high costs and increasing monitoring quality. To this end, the high mobility of UAVs combined with a high level of autonomy, sensor-driven technologies, and AI-based decision-making abilities can provide many advantages to farmers in exploiting instant information from every corner of a large farm. The key objective of this research is to develop an automated airborne monitoring system that can fuse onboard sensor data sets and accurately detect animals and health anomalies, so the information can be presented in an easy-to-understand on-demand format for farmers so that they can take targeted or pre-emptive action, and improve the health, welfare, and productivity of their livestock. In this research, an intelligent drone solution with a cross-discipline approach has been developed to periodically survey livestock in an automated manner by using vision-based sensor modalities involving both standard visual band sensing and a thermal imager. The experimental results suggest that the accuracy rates of detecting livestock are very high, with sensitivity and specificity values of 0.97 and 1.0 respectively. Additionally, the results regarding the animal body heat signatures obtained from the thermal imagery show promising results in detecting disease-related cases. The research demonstrates how highly integrated technologies with drones can help the farming industry overcome the challenging issues in livestock management. © 2024 11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

	abstract = {In the field of veterinary medicine, the detection of parasite eggs in the fecal samples of livestock animals represents one of the most challenging tasks, since their spread and diffusion may lead to severe clinical disease. Nowadays, the scanning procedure is typically performed by physicians with professional microscopes and requires a significant amount of time, domain knowledge, and resources. The Kubic FLOTAC Microscope (KFM) is a compact, low-cost, portable digital microscope that can autonomously analyze fecal specimens for parasites and hosts in both field and laboratory settings. It has been shown to acquire images that are comparable to those obtained with traditional optical microscopes, and it can complete the scanning and imaging process in just a few minutes, freeing up the operator's time for other tasks. To promote research in this area, the first AI-KFM challenge was organized, which focused on the detection of gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) in cattle using RGB images. The challenge aimed to provide a standardized experimental protocol with a large number of samples collected in a well-known environment and a set of scores for the approaches submitted by the competitors. This paper describes the process of generating and structuring the challenge dataset and the approaches submitted by the competitors, as well as the lessons learned throughout this journey.

	abstract = {Non-professional vegetables gardens (NPVGs) can be urban, peri-urban or agricultural, and only 15% of these have a surface smaller than 50 m2, with exclusively family production and having only manual equipment. Another 40% includes NPVGs with up to 1000 m2, structured for a vegetable production but also with fruit trees, livestock and wooded areas. NPVGs up to 1 ha are 15%, and 30% are over 1 ha with wooded areas. About 20 million people in Italy are involved in this agricultural reality, implementing an economic and social value, and the sector of gardening machinery and equipment has seen considerable increases in these last years. Indeed, the management of NPVGs also includes a wide type of machinery and processes for the preservation of products; the data show that 54% of NPVGs have mechanical equipment, with work tools such as chainsaws, blowers/aspirators, motor hoes, robotic lawn mowers, etc. The problem of user safety in operating these machines emerges prominently, accentuated by the fact that this is an unregistered reality and there is no obligation for users’ training or for the provision of personal protection equipment (PPE) other than the ones supplied when machines are purchased. The training of operators of NPVGs is less thorough and, generally, it does not encompass the conditions of use of equipment, especially for those machines that can be dangerous if used improperly, such as: chainsaws, rotary hoes, and log splitters. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

This led implementation of such methods in various application fields including defense industry, smart cities, intelligent video analytics, industrial inspection, and healthcare. Success of these applications enabled agriculture and livestock management to benefit from such implementations in recent years. In this work, we proposed an end-to-end workflow for deep learning-based computer vision applications to facilitate the AI model training, model optimization, model deployment, metadata streaming, metadata recording, result filtering/searching and data visualization. The source data of the visualizations as result of the analysis are stored in a high-performance database presented within the scope of the study. On the other hand, using the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and infrastructures, both model training and inference performance-oriented classification model comparison were carried out. In order to compare the developed models with the models developed in other studies in the literature, the training and inference process were tested on the same open-source data set. The workflow is proposed as a hybrid solution that can be deployed both on streamline x86 computer systems and ARM64 embedded devices. Therefore, deployment benchmarks for servers and NVIDIA Jetson devices are also provided within the paper. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is an annual plant belonging to the family of Cannabaceae with several varieties characterized by different fatty acid profile, content in flavonoids, polyphenols, and cannabinoid compounds. Hemp is mostly used in livestock nutrition as oil or as protein cake, but not as inflorescences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary hemp inflorescences on milk yield and composition in grazing dairy goats. Twenty Camosciata delle Alpi goats at their 3rd parity and with a mean body weight of 45.2 ± 2.0 kg, immediately after kidding, were equally allocated into two groups (G: Grazing and GH: grazing and hemp). For three months, all goats were fed on a permanent pasture and received 700/head/day of concentrate; diet of group GH was supplemented with 20 g/head/day of hemp inflorescences. Goats’ body weight did not change during the trial. Individual milk yield was daily recorded and samples collected every 20 days for chemical composition and fatty acid profile analysis. No significant differences were found for milk yield and chemical composition. Caproic (C6:0) (1.80 vs. 1.74%; p < 0.01) and lauric acids (C12:0) were significantly higher in milk of group GH (4.83 vs. 4.32%; p < 0.01) as well as linoleic (C18:2) (2.04 vs. 1.93%; p < 0.05), adrenic acid (C22:4) (0.046 vs. 0.031%, p < 0.05), omega-6/omega-3 ratio (3.17 vs. 2.93, p < 0.05) and total conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) (0.435 vs. 0.417%; p < 0.01). The results of this study suggest that the supplementation of grazing goats’ diet with hemp inflorescences may enhance the milk nutritional characteristics by increasing its content of CLAs and other beneficial fatty acids. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Automated Milking Systems (AMS) have undergone significant evolution over the past 30 yr, and their adoption continues to increase, as evidenced by the growing scientific literature. These systems offer advantages such as a reduced milking workload and increased milk yield per cow. However, given concerns about the welfare of farmed animals, studying the effects of AMS on the health and welfare of animals becomes crucial for the overall sustainability of the dairy sector. In the last few years, some analysis conducted through text mining (TM) and topic analysis (TA) approaches have become increasingly widespread in the livestock sector. The aim of the study was to analyze the scientific literature on the impact of AMS on dairy cow health, welfare, and behavior: the paper aimed to produce a comprehensive analysis on this topic using TM and TA approaches. After a preprocessing phase, a dataset of 427 documents was analyzed. The abstracts of the selected papers were analyzed by TM and a TA using Software R 4.3.1. A Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) technique was used to assign a relative weight to each term. According to the results of the TM, the ten most important terms, both words and roots, were feed, farm, teat, concentr, mastiti, group, SCC (somatic cell count), herd, lame and pasture. The 10 most important terms showed TFIDF values greater than 3.5, with feed showing a value of TFIDF of 5.43 and pasture of 3.66. Eight topics were selected with TA, namely: 1) Cow traffic and time budget, 2) Farm management, 3) Udder health, 4) Comparison with conventional milking, 5) Milk production, 6) Analysis of AMS data, 7) Disease detection, 8) Feeding management. Over the years, the focus of documents has shifted from cow traffic, udder health and cow feeding to the analysis of data recorded by the robot to monitor animal conditions and welfare and promptly identify the onset of stress or diseases. The analysis reveals the complex nature of the relationship between AMS and animal welfare, health, and behavior: on one hand, the robot offers interesting opportunities to safeguard animal welfare and health, especially for the possibility of early identification of anomalous conditions using sensors and data; on the other hand, it poses potential risks, which requires further investigations. TM offers an alternative approach to information retrieval in livestock science, especially when dealing with a substantial volume of documents. Lay Summary Milking robots have revolutionized the cow milking, reducing dependence on human labor and increasing milk yield per cow. However, addressing concerns about farmed animal welfare and overall sustainability is crucial. This paper presents a text-mining analysis of the scientific literature to explore the effects of robotic milking on cow health, welfare, and behavior. The analysis revealed a growing body of research studies on these subjects, highlighting the complex nature of the relationship between automated milking, welfare, health, and cow behavior. Robotic milking has the potential to enhance animal health and living conditions, but the associated risks require further investigation. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Mathematical modeling is typically framed as the art of reductionism of scientific knowledge into an arithmetical layout. However, most untrained people get the art of modeling wrong and end up neglecting it because modeling is not simply about writing equations and generating numbers through simulations. Models tell not only about a story; they are spoken to by the circumstances under which they are envisioned. They guide apprentice and experienced modelers to build better models by preventing known pitfalls and invalid assumptions in the virtual world and, most importantly, learn from them through simulation and identify gaps in pushing scientific knowledge further. The power of the human mind is well-documented for idealizing concepts and creating virtual reality models, and as our hypotheses grow more complicated and more complex data become available, modeling earns more noticeable footing in biological sciences. The fundamental modeling paradigms include discrete-events, dynamic systems, agent-based (AB), and system dynamics (SD). The source of knowledge is the most critical step in the model-building process regardless of the paradigm, and the necessary expertise includes (a) clear and concise mental concepts acquired through different ways that provide the fundamental structure and expected behaviors of the model and (b) numerical data necessary for statistical analysis, not for building the model. The unreasonable effectiveness of models to grow scientific learning and knowledge in sciences arise because different researchers would model the same problem differently, given their knowledge and experiential background, leading to choosing different variables and model structures. Secondly, different researchers might use different paradigms and even unalike mathematics to resolve the same problem; thus, model needs are intrinsic to their perceived assumptions and structures. Thirdly, models evolve as the scientific community knowledge accumulates and matures over time, hopefully resulting in improved modeling efforts; thus, the perfect model is fictional. Some paradigms are most appropriate for macro, high abstraction with less detailed-oriented scenarios, while others are most suitable for micro, low abstraction with higher detailed-oriented strategies. Modern hybridization aggregating artificial intelligence (AI) to mathematical models can become the next technological wave in modeling. AI can be an integral part of the SD/AB models and, before long, write the model code by itself. Success and failures in model building are more related to the ability of the researcher to interpret the data and understand the underlying principles and mechanisms to formulate the correct relationship among variables rather than profound mathematical knowledge. © 2023 The Author},

	abstract = {Intensification of livestock production systems is mainly driven by increasing population and subsequent increase in food demand. Major challenges of an intensified system are monitoring of a large number of animals, fast disease spread, frequent monitoring of health status, scarcity of labor, and optimizing the resources to maximize the profit. Different modern technologies are used to overcome these challenges; computer vision and image analysis techniques are the primary ones. The computer vision approach has gained prominence in contemporary livestock farming and has become an essential component of the farming system in many developed nations. This chapter provides insights into various applications of computer vision and image processing technologies (tracking of individual animals, health and disease monitoring, body size and weight measurement, and analysis of milk and meat quality), limitations, research gaps, and future prospects. This technology reduces labor requirements, eases management, is more precise in monitoring, and acts as a supporting tool for decision-making. However, the need for substantial initial capital, technical knowledge, regular monitoring, breed or strain-specific calibrations, and selection of correct features are identified as challenges of this technology. Lacks automation in computer vision technology, inadequate application of artificial intelligence in thermal imaging, identifying the optimum features for detection of lameness and lack of user-friendly applications are a few identified research gaps. Although computer vision has been implemented in livestock farming, it is still at the intermediate level and the identified challenges and research gaps need to be addressed through research and development for full-fledged automated livestock management. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The ovulation of a mature oocyte at metaphase II of meiosis, with optimal potential to undergo fertilisation by a sperm cell, complete meiosis and sustain the switch to mitotic division, and support early embryo development, involves a protracted and disrupted/delayed series of processes. Many of these are targeted for exploitation in vivo, or recapitulation in vitro, by the livestock industry. Reproductive technologies, including AI, multiple ovulation embryo transfer, ovum pick-up, in vitro embryo production, and oestrus and ovulation synchronisation, offer practitioners and producers the opportunity to produce offspring from genetically valuable dams in much greater numbers than they would normally have in their lifetime, while in vitro oocyte and follicle culture are important platforms for researchers to interrogate the physiological mechanisms driving fertility. The majority of these technologies target the ovarian follicle and the oocyte within; thus, the quality and capability of the recovered oocyte determine the success of the reproductive intervention. Molecular and microscopical technologies have grown exponentially, providing powerful platforms to interrogate the molecular mechanisms which are integral to or affected by ART. The development of the bovine oocyte from its differentiation in the ovary to ovulation is described in the light of its relevance to key aspects of individual interventions, while highlighting the historical timeline. © 2024 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

The One Health approach links human, animal, and environmental sectors with the goal of achieving a holistic understanding of health in general. To implement this approach, diverse and heterogeneous data streams and types must be combined and analyzed. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques offer new opportunities for cross-sectoral assessment of current and future health threats. Using the example of antimicrobial resistance as a global threat in the One Health context, we demonstrate potential applications and challenges of AI techniques. This article provides an overview of different applications of AI techniques in the context of One Health and highlights their challenges. Using the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), an increasing global threat, as an example, existing and future AI-based approaches to AMR containment and prevention are described.

We evaluated thirteen greenhouse gas (GHG)-based decision support systems (DSS), considering criteria such as not only the accessibility, user-friendliness, stakeholder involvement, sustainability methodology, and modeling aspects, but also the input parameters and outputs provided, all crucial for decision making. While most DSSs provide information for facilitating their use, only four are suitable for inexperienced users, and stakeholder participation in DSS development is infrequent. The dominant methodology for farm-level GHG estimation is IPCC 2006, with quantitative models primarily used for indicators’ assessment. Scenario and contribution analyses are the prevailing decision support approaches. Soil, crop, and fertilizer types are the most implemented non-livestock-related inputs, while climate- and feed-related costs are the least required. All DSSs assess farm-level mitigation measures, but less than half offer sustainability consultation. These tools promote environmental sustainability by evaluating mitigation strategies, disseminating farm sustainability information, and guiding sustainable farm management. Yet, challenges such as disparate estimation methods, result variations, comparison difficulties, usability concerns, steep learning curves, the lack of automation, the necessity for multiple tools, the limited integration of the results, and changing regulations hinder their wider adoption. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, avian influenza (AI) outbreaks have been reported across different parts of the globe, resulting in large-scale economic and livestock loss and, in some cases raising concerns about their zoonotic potential. The virulence and pathogenicity of H5Nx (e.g., H5N1, H5N2) AI strains for poultry could be inferred through various approaches, and it has been frequently performed by detecting certain pathogenicity markers in their haemagglutinin (HA) gene. The utilization of predictive modeling methods represents a possible approach to exploring this genotypic-phenotypic relationship for assisting experts in determining the pathogenicity of circulating AI viruses. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive performance of different machine learning (ML) techniques for in-silico prediction of pathogenicity of H5Nx viruses in poultry, using complete genetic sequences of the HA gene. We annotated 2137 H5Nx HA gene sequences based on the presence of the polybasic HA cleavage site (HACS) with 46.33% and 53.67% of sequences previously identified as highly pathogenic (HP) and low pathogenic (LP), respectively. We compared the performance of different ML classifiers (e.g., logistic regression (LR) with the lasso and ridge regularization, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN)) for pathogenicity classification of raw H5Nx nucleotide and protein sequences using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. We found that different ML techniques can be successfully used for the pathogenicity classification of H5 sequences with ∼99% classification accuracy. Our results indicate that for pathogenicity classification of (1) aligned deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and protein sequences, with NB classifier had the lowest accuracies of 98.41% (+/−0.89) and 98.31% (+/−1.06), respectively; (2) aligned DNA and protein sequences, with LR (L1/L2), KNN, SVM (radial basis function (RBF)) and CNN classifiers had the highest accuracies of 99.20% (+/−0.54) and 99.20% (+/−0.38), respectively; (3) unaligned DNA and protein sequences, with CNN's achieved accuracies of 98.54% (+/−0.68) and 99.20% (+/−0.50), respectively. ML methods show potential for regular classification of H5Nx virus pathogenicity for poultry species, particularly when sequences containing regular markers were frequently present in the training dataset. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The introduction of computer vision and machine learning into agricultural systems has produced significant new opportunities for high precision application of liquid products in both grain and livestock agriculture. These technologies, which enable liquid application in site-specific, non-broadcast applications, are driving new evaluations of nozzle technologies which apply a consistent dose of liquid product in a non-conventional manner compared to historic perceptions. This field of innovation is driving the need for improved high-capacity systems for evaluating nozzle performance in high-precision applications. Historically, patternator tables with volumetric measurements of total applied liquid have served as the standard for fluid nozzle evaluation. These volumetric measurements are based on measuring the displaced distance of liquid over a defined time to determine flow rate. However, current distance sensors present challenges for achieving small-volume measurements and enabling automation at a scale necessary to meet innovation demands of high-precision nozzle systems. A novel concept for high speed and automated measurement of a high precision patternator table was developed using an ultrasonic sensor and a carefully designed liquid retainment system to maximize measurement precision. The performance of this system was quantified by comparing calibrations and performance across different vessels for volume measurement (tubes and pipes) used in the application of a nozzle patternator. A total of three square tubes (15.9, 22.3, 31.0 mm widths) and three pipes (25.2, 27.0, 35.1 mm diameters) were evaluated, with the 27 mm pipe matching the ultrasonic sensor’s rating. All calibrations were successful, depicting linear characteristics with R2 > 0.99. The smallest pipe presented issues for the sensor to measure in post-calibration and was thus not evaluated further. The residual values from operational performance highlight that the 25.2 mm tube and the 27.0 mm pipe are highly accurate with no indication of bias or non-normality. The relative uncertainty ranges from 2.9 to 42% (350 mL to 25 mL) depending on the tube and pipe cross-sectional diameter or width with the sensor accuracy and uncertainty in the tube and pipe area being the largest factors. The results of this study indicate that the 25.2 mm tube and the 27.0 mm pipe could be excellent options for autonomous liquid volume measurement with the ultrasonic sensor. A key challenge identified in this study is that the assumptions in the sensor’s intrinsic calibration are violated with the tubes and pipes evaluated. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Cattle management plays a crucial role in determining the productivity of livestock farms. With the expansion of large-scale livestock operations, it has become increasingly impractical for livestock managers to rely on traditional visual observations for comprehensive monitoring of cattle behaviors, encompassing health and overall welfare. Consequently, the incorporation of automation technology in livestock management is emphasized. The objective of this study is the video-based identification of cattle behavior that can be utilized in automated cattle management systems. With a specific focus on behaviors closely associated with their management, the study employs deep learning-based action classification methods over the commonly used object detection. This approach enables the classification of intricate, repetitive, and slow behaviors that were challenging to detect. Furthermore, a novel method named FlowEQ transform was introduced, incorporating temporal information into the input data. This enhancement proved instrumental in providing valuable insights for inferring cattle behavior, resulting in an impressive 8% improvement in classification performance and achieving a high accuracy rate of 91.5%. The utilization of action classification and the introduction of the innovative FlowEQ transform mark a significant advancement in automated cattle management. This approach is poised to enhance the efficiency of behavior monitoring on livestock farms.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Automated behavior analysis (ABA) strategies are being researched at a rapid rate to detect an array of behaviors across a range of species. There is growing optimism that soon ethologists will not have to manually decode hours (and hours) of animal behavior videos, but that instead computers will process them for us. However, before we assume ABA is ready for practical use, it is important to take a realistic look at exactly what ABA is being developed, the expertise being used to develop it, and the context in which these studies occur. Once we understand common pitfalls occurring during ABA development and identify limitations, we can construct robust ABA tools to achieve automated (ultimately even continuous and real time) analysis of behavioral data, allowing for more detailed or longer-term studies of behavior on larger numbers of animals than ever before. ABA is only as good as it is trained to be. A key starting point is having manually annotated data for model training and assessment. However, most ABA developers are not trained in ethology. Often no formal ethogram is developed and descriptions of target behaviors in ABA publications are limited or inaccurate. In addition, ABA is also frequently developed using small datasets, which lack sufficient variability in animal morphometrics, activities, camera viewpoints, and environmental features to be generalizable. Thus, ABA often needs to be further validated before being used satisfactorily on different populations or under other conditions, even for research purposes. Multidisciplinary teams of researchers including ethologists and ethicists as well as computer scientists, data scientists, and engineers are needed to help address problems when applying computer vision ABA to measure behavior. Reference datasets that can be used for behavior detection should be generated and shared that include image data, annotations, and baseline analyses for benchmarking. Also critical is the development of standards for creating such reference datasets and descriptions of best practices for methods for validating results from detection tools to ensure they are robust and generalizable. At present, only a handful of publicly available datasets exist that can be used for development of ABA tools. As we work to realize the promise of ABA (and subsequent precision livestock farming technologies) to detect animal behavior, a clear understanding of best practices, access to accurately annotated datasets, and networking among ethologists and ABA developers will increase our chances for rapid and robust successes. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Low-power sensor networks are transforming large-scale sensing in precision farming, livestock tracking, climate-monitoring and surveying. Accurate and robust localization in such low-power sensor nodes has never been as crucial as it is today. This paper presents, Sirius, a self-localization system using a single receiver for low-power IoT nodes. Traditionally, systems have relied on antenna arrays and tight synchronization to estimate angle-of-arrival (AoA) and time-of-flight with known access points. While these techniques work well for regular mobile systems, low-power IoT nodes lack the resources to support these complex systems. Sirius explores the use of gain-pattern reconfigurable antennas with passive envelope detector-based radios to perform AoA estimation without requiring any kind of synchronization. It shows a technique to embed direction specific codes to the received signals which are transparent to regular communication channel but carry AoA information with them. Sirius embeds these direction-specific codes by using reconfigurable antennas and fluctuating the gain pattern of the antenna. Our prototype demonstrates a median error of 7 degrees in AoA estimation and 2.5 meters in localization, which is similar to state-of-the-art antenna array-based systems. Sirius opens up new possibilities for low-power IoT nodes.  © 2023 Owner/Author(s).},

	abstract = {The objective of this observational study was to evaluate the association of transition cow health and estrous expression, detected by an automated activity monitoring system (Smarttag Neck, Nedap Livestock Management), with reproductive performance in lactating Holstein cows. A total of 3,750 lactating Holstein cows (1,563 primiparous cows and 2,187 multiparous cows) from a commercial dairy farm in Slovakia calving from January 2020 until July 2021 were enrolled on an ongoing basis. Activity data were recorded from d 7 until d 60 postpartum. Within this observational period, cows were classified into 3 categories: (1) no estrus event (Estrus0), (2) 1 estrus event (Estrus1), or (3) 2 or more estrus events (Estrus2+). Transition cow health was assessed by farm personnel within the first 30 d in milk (DIM) using standard operating procedures. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze continuous and categorical data. Cox proportional hazard models were used for time to event data. The overall prevalence of anestrus was 20.8%. Multiparous cows had a greater risk for anestrus compared with primiparous cows [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4]. Cows with stillbirth (OR = 1.76), retained placenta (OR = 2.19), puerperal metritis (OR = 1.48), or subclinical ketosis (OR = 1.51) had a greater risk for anestrus. In addition, cows calving in summer (OR = 0.82), autumn (OR = 0.38), or winter (OR = 0.56) had a higher incidence of anestrus than cows calving in spring. Estrous expression from d 7 until d 60 postpartum was associated with estrous duration (DU) and estrous intensity at first artificial insemination (AI). Cows in Estrus0 had the shortest DU at first postpartum AI (9.4 ± 0.18 h) compared with cows in Estrus1 (10.5 ± 0.13 h) and Estrus2+ (11.4 ± 0.12 h). Cows in Estrus2+ had a longer DU at first postpartum AI compared with cows in Estrus1. For Estrus0, Estrus1, and Estrus2+ cows, pregnancy per AI at first service was 42.5%, 50.9%, and 55.4%, respectively. Estrous expression from d 7 until d 60 postpartum was associated with time to first AI and time to pregnancy. Compared with Estrus0 cows, Estrus1 [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.43] and Estrus2+ cows (HR = 1.62) had an increased hazard of being inseminated within 100 DIM. Compared with Estrus2+, Estrus1 cows had a reduced hazard of being inseminated within 100 DIM (HR = 0.89). Compared with Estrus0 cows, Estrus1 (HR = 1.24) and Estrus2+ cows (HR = 1.46) had an increased hazard of becoming pregnant within 200 DIM. Median DIM to pregnancy were 121, 96, and 92 for Estrus0, Estrus1, and Estrus2+ cows, respectively. In conclusion, cows with transition cow disorders (i.e., stillbirth, retained placenta, puerperal metritis, or subclinical ketosis) had a greater chance for anestrus compared with healthy cows. Cows in Estrus0 had reduced estrous expression at first AI and inferior reproductive performance compared with cows that displayed estrous activity from d 7 until d 60. © 2023 American Dairy Science Association},

	abstract = {Cattle identification is pivotal for many reasons. Animal health management, traceability, bread classification, and verification of insurance claims are largely depended on the accurate identification of the animals. Conventionally, animals have been identified by various means such as ear tags, tattoos, rumen implants, and hot brands. Being non-scientific approaches, these controls can be easily circumvented. The emerging technologies of biometric identification are extensively applied for Human recognition via thumb impression, face features, or eye retina patterns. The application of biometric recognition technology has now moved towards animals. Cattle identification with the help of muzzle patterns has shown tremendous results. For precise identification, nature has awarded a unique Muzzle pattern that can be utilized as a primary biometric feature. Muzzle pattern image scanning for biometric identification has now been extensively applied for identification. Animal recognition via Muzzle pattern image for different applications has been proliferating gradually. One of those applications includes the identification of fake insurance claims under livestock insurance. Fraudulent animal owners tend to lodge fake claims against livestock insurance with proxy animals. In this paper, we proposed the solution to avoid and/or discard fraudulent claims of livestock insurance by intelligently identifying the proxy animals. Data collection of animal muzzle patterns remained challenging. Key aspects of the proposed system include: (1) the Animal face will be detected through visual using YOLO v7 object detector. (2) After face detection, the same procedures will apply to detect muzzle point (3) the muzzle pattern is extracted and then stored in the database. The System has a mean average precision of 100% for the face and 99.43% for the nose/muzzle point of the animal. Once the animal is registered in the database, the identification process is initiated by extracting unique nose pattern features with ORB and/or SIFT. Then it is matched using the pattern matchers like BFMatcher and/or FLANNMatcher for animal identification. The proposed model is more efficient and accurate as compared to concurrent approaches. The results extracted from this research study show 100% accurate identification. © 2023},

	abstract = {Four species of Giardia out of nine have been identified in rodents based on molecular data: G. muris, G. microti, G. cricetidarum, and G. duodenalis. A total of seven G. duodenalis assemblages (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) have been identified in rodents to date. The zoonotic assemblages A and B are responsible for 74.88% (480/641) of the total identified genotypes in rodents by statistic. For sub-assemblage A in humans, AII is responsible for 71.02% (1397/1967) of the identified sub-assemblages, followed by AI with 26.39% (519/1967) and AIII with 1.17% (23/1967), indicating a significantly greater zoonotic potential for G. duodenalis infections in humans originating from animals. For sub-assemblages of type A in rodents, AI was identified in 86.89% (53/61), and AII in 4.92% (3/61). For assemblage B, 60.84% (390/641) were identified in rodents as having zoonotic potential to humans. In environmental samples, the zoonotic assemblages A and B were responsible for 83.81% (533/636) in water samples, 86.96% (140/161) in fresh produce samples, and 100% (8/8) in soil samples. The same zoonotic potential assemblage A or B simultaneously identified in humans, rodents, and environment samples had potential zoonotic transmission between humans and animals via a synanthropic environment. The infections and zoonotic potential for G. duodenalis were higher in farmed rodents and pet rodents than that in zoo, lab, and wild rodents. In conclusion, the role of rodents in zoonotic transmission of giardiasis should be noticed. In addition to rodents, dogs, cats, wild animals, and livestock could be involved in the zoonotic transmission cycle. This study aims to explore the current situation of giardiasis in rodents and seeks to delineate the role of rodents in the zoonotic transmission of giardiasis from the One Health perspective. © 2023},

	abstract = {This study examines the effects of three irrigation regimes with a combination of saline water and treated wastewater on the accumulation of heavy metals in barley grains. A field experiment was designed as a split-split plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design, in which treatments were different irrigation regimes (50%, 70%, and 100% full irrigation) and irrigation water types (saline water [SW], treated wastewater [TW], mixed water resources [MWR], and alternative irrigation [AI]). After cultivation and harvesting of the barley crop, the grain yield, 1000-grain weight, and contents of heavy metals in the grains were measured. The grain yield was enhanced by TW alone, MWR, and AI to 12.8%, 5%, and 9.5% under 70%-deficit irrigation; and 58.3%, 21.7%, and 8.7% under full irrigation, respectively. Based on the guidelines for safe limits of heavy metals in edible plants and livestock feed, the barley grains were safe for livestock and toxic for humans. The trend of heavy metal contents in the grains was Fe > Zn > Pb > Cu ≥ Cr > Cd. Irrigation with SW compared with TW increased Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Cr contents in the grains to 11.75%, 10.97%, 5.22%, 19.15%, 3.45%, and 9.21%, respectively. The amounts of toxic elements of Cd and Pb were maximized by using MWR, whereas the Cr content in the grain was maximized by using AI. There were no significant difference in the metal uptake by the grains among all irrigation regimes in any irrigation water resource. However, compared with the other irrigation regimes, the full irrigation resulted in lower Zn, Cu, and Cd contents, whereas the 50%-deficit irrigation led to lower Pb and Cr contents in the grains. Therefore, irrigation with TW is recommended based on the grain yield, whereas AI is suggested due to lower Cu, Pb, and Cd contents in the grain, and MWR is recommended due to lower Cr content. Furthermore, full and 50%-deficit irrigation regimes are recommended to, respectively, maximize grain yield and minimize the toxic metal contents in the grain. Practitioner Points: Mixed saline water and treated wastewater and alternative irrigation enhanced grain yield. Saline water versus treated wastewater increased the grain heavy metal contents. Alternative irrigation decreased Fe, Cu, Pb, and Cd amounts in the grain. Grain Cu content had strong relationship with irrigation regime. 50%-deficit irrigation minimized Pb and Cr contents in the grain. © 2023 Water Environment Federation.},

	abstract = {This review was conducted to demonstrate how artificial intelligence (AI) has affected livestock farming. Livestock is essential for maintaining ecological integrity and providing food security. In this review, the history of artificial intelligence (AI), its impact on current and future livestock farming, and its drawbacks have been highlighted. The term "artificial intelligence,"was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956, and currently, the technology is widely applied in the management of many livestock farms like poultry, dairy, and pigs. Although it has been studied for decades and widely applied, AI is still one of the least understood subfields. Artificial intelligence provides farmers with unrivalled support, enabling them to minimize resource use, improve the sustainability of their feeding patterns, and increase farm productivity in general, especially when it comes to reducing the carbon footprint. AI is a blessing for boosting efficiency and productivity while also lowering the possibility of human error. Producers can use artificial intelligence to simulate human decision-making and provide interpretations and solutions for the data gathered by sensors and other hardware technologies. Through AI tools, it is possible to easily trace animal activities and locations and collect data about behaviors, habitats, and health conditions. Animal identification, animal welfare monitoring, sex determination, vaccine delivery, and pasture evaluation are some areas where AI has been widely applied so far. Drones, robots, and blockchains are some forms of automation that have been widely used in dairy farms. However, the expense of development, which needs more infrastructure on the farm, and the potential for automation to replace them are the limitations of the technology.  © 2024 Awoke Melak et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Breeding objectives are designed to achieve targeted dairy cow production goals, which can be affected by production type, farmer preferences, environmental factors and genetic factors individually or in combination. Breeding practices, such as both controlled and uncontrolled, and artificial insemination (AI) are the tools used to obtain the desired breeding objectives. The lower reproductive performance of indigenous dairy cows affects the total milk production and calf crops that are produced during their lifetime. Designing appropriate breeding objectives and breeding practices can improve the reproductive performance of dairy cows and their overall production performance. Materials and methods: The current study was conducted with the objective of evaluating the breeding, practices and performance of indigenous dairy cattle in the south western part of Ethiopia. The districts of Gesha and Chena were purposefully chosen. The study design for the 384 household surveys was a cross-sectional survey with a simple random sample approach. Data analysis was carried out by MS-Excel (2010) and the general linear model procedure of SAS of 2008. Results: The current study revealed that methods of breeding were predominantly natural-controlled mating, followed by natural-uncontrolled mating and AI in descending order. Breeding objectives were input function, output function, sociocultural and economic functions and assets and security functions in decreasing order of rank. Reproduction performance indexes of indigenous dairy cows age at first service (3.72 ± 0.05 years), age at first calving (AFC) (4.71 ± 0.07 years), calving interval (CI) (1.58 ± 0.03 years), days open (DO) (4.26 ± 0.11 months), services per conception in natural mating (1.4 ± 0.08) and AI (2.73 ± 0.14), age of bull at maturity (4.17 ± 0.74 years), interoestrus interval (23.18 ± 0.61 days), calves crop (7.53 ± 0.22) and the life span of indigenous dairy cow (11.94 ± 0.26 years) were significant (p < 0.01) between two districts, whereas the values of age of bull at maturity and number of services per conception in natural mating were significant (p < 0.05) between districts. Conclusions: Using AI and major reproduction performances, such as AFC, CI and DO of indigenous dairy cows in the study area, were very low. Therefore, concerned bodies should intervene to improve reproduction performance through the utilization of AI techniques, with the integration of forage development activities and improvements in livestock health care. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {In future decades, the demand for poultry meat and eggs is predicted to considerably increase in pace with human population growth. Although this expansion clearly represents a remarkable opportunity for the sector, it conceals a multitude of challenges. Pollution and land erosion, competition for limited resources between animal and human nutrition, animal welfare concerns, limitations on the use of growth promoters and antimicrobial agents, and increasing risks and effects of animal infectious diseases and zoonoses are several topics that have received attention from authorities and the public. The increase in poultry production must be achieved mainly through optimization and increased efficiency. The increasing ability to generate large amounts of data (“big data”) is pervasive in both modern society and the farming industry. Information accessibility—coupled with the availability of tools and computational power to store, share, integrate, and analyze data with automatic and flexible algorithms—offers an unprecedented opportunity to develop tools to maximize farm profitability, reduce socio-environmental impacts, and increase animal and human health and welfare. A detailed description of all topics and applications of big data analysis in poultry farming would be infeasible. Therefore, the present work briefly reviews the application of sensor technologies, such as optical, acoustic, and wearable sensors, as well as infrared thermal imaging and optical flow, to poultry farming. The principles and benefits of advanced statistical techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, and their use in developing effective and reliable classification and prediction models to benefit the farming system, are also discussed. Finally, recent progress in pathogen genome sequencing and analysis is discussed, highlighting practical applications in epidemiological tracking, and reconstruction of microorganisms’ population dynamics, evolution, and spread. The benefits of the objective evaluation of the effectiveness of applied control strategies are also considered. Although human-artificial intelligence collaborations in the livestock sector can be frightening because they require farmers and employees in the sector to adapt to new roles, challenges, and competencies—and because several unknowns, limitations, and open-ended questions are inevitable—their overall benefits appear to be far greater than their drawbacks. As more farms and companies connect to technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and sensing technologies will begin to play a greater role in identifying patterns and solutions to pressing problems in modern animal farming, thus providing remarkable production-based and commercial advantages. Moreover, the combination of diverse sources and types of data will also become fundamental for the development of predictive models able to anticipate, rather than merely detect, disease occurrence. The increasing availability of sensors, infrastructures, and tools for big data collection, storage, sharing, and analysis—together with the use of open standards and integration with pathogen molecular epidemiology—have the potential to address the major challenge of producing higher-quality, more healthful food on a larger scale in a more sustainable manner, thereby protecting ecosystems, preserving natural resources, and improving animal and human welfare and health. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is a crucial sector for every country's economy, as it provides livestock and crops that are essential for farmers and their families' survival. Crop diseases significantly impact farmers' livelihood, making early detection and accurate diagnosis essential for informed crop management decisions that can improve yield and crop quality. While the manual diagnosis of plant diseases has limitations, research on automatic plant disease identification and categorization using computer vision algorithms is a popular research topic. We focus on leaf disease recognition and compare classification techniques to object detection techniques. Classification techniques in leaf disease recognition involve assigning an input image of a leaf to one of the pre-defined classes or categories, such as "healthy"or "diseased."Object detection techniques, on the other hand, involve identifying the presence of an object of interest (e.g., a leaf) in an image and locating its boundaries, in addition to classifying the object. The advantage of object detection techniques over classification techniques in leaf disease recognition is that they provide additional information about the location of the disease on the leaf, which can be useful for tasks such as disease diagnosis and monitoring. In our work, 5100 chilli leaf images of 6 different classes were collected and labeled using the makeSense artificial intelligence (AI) annotating tool; we applied the YOLOv5s object detection model, producing a precision of 0.951, recall of 0.926, mAP@0.5 of 0.959, mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.826, and accuracy of 95%. We also proposed an enhanced single-stage object detection model that employs the exponential linear unit activation function in the convolution layers and the sigmoid activation function at the output layer, resulting in a precision of 0.998, recall of 0.998, mAP@0.5 of 0.995, mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.975, and accuracy of 99.83% for the chilli leaf dataset.  © 2023 SPIE and IS & T.},

	abstract = {According to data from Govt. of India, agriculture is a high-priority sector of the Indian economy, with 58% of all families dependent on it directly or indirectly, for their livelihoods. With increasing world population, climate change and limited arable land, the current practices in agriculture are becoming unsustainable for both people and planet as they incur huge environmental cost and wastage. These in turn leave the small producers at or below the poverty level. Therefore, there is an urgent need of paradigm shift in this domain, and adoption of digital and AI based technologies can aid in the shift. AI and Data-driven technologies have the potential to enhance productivity and efficiency, thus generating higher farm income, waste reduction and sustainability. By collecting and analyzing data from various sources such as reports, images, sensors, drones, and other sources, farmers can gain a deeper understanding of their fields and crops. This information can then be used to make more precise decisions about irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and other farming practices. AI and data driven techniques are also gaining traction in the precision livestock management. From sensor based farm and animal behavior monitoring to veterinary medicine - AI based systems have found several applications. In this tutorial we will briefly describe about how we can apply state of the art ML/DL techniques on data from different modalities and different perspective to gain useful insights on enhanced agricultural output.  © 2023 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {Sensors are tools designed to perceive stimuli (input) and respond as measurable output in various forms, useful for us. Advancements in sensor technology in the past two decades have made the life of humans easier and so is the case of managing livestock. Livestock management needs great skills as various kinds of needs of animals are to be satisfied to keep them not only healthy but to secure optimal performance. Sensors help in the improvement of managerial skills at farms depending upon the types and quantum of sensors utilized. It even helps in the standardization of various farm practices leading to efficient energy utilization for thermoregulation and other performance traits. The use of sensors based on modern artificial intelligence (AI) and information technologies (IT) including Internet of Things (IoT) applications has led to the transition of traditional livestock farming into precision livestock farming (PLF) or smart animal agriculture. The majority of the early developed sensors focused on the economic performance of animals, i.e., production, physiology, health, reproduction, etc., however recently, the focus has shifted to cover behavior and welfare traits as well to address the rising concerns of industrial livestock production, through estimation of animal welfare indicators (AWIs), especially with the emergence of biosensors. Though there are hundreds of sensor-based tools available in the market, the validation part still needs major impetus. Use of sensors in the livestock sector has remained restricted to date due to the requirement of additional infrastructure, moderate to higher skills for use and interpretation of outcomes, financial constraints especially at small herds, shortage of sensor availability, etc., as mostly seen in under-developed and developing countries. Issues related to the wider use of sensor technologies such as unemployment, livestock welfare, and others, seem to fade away with benefits overweighing the concerns due to parallel industrialization and the evolution of cheaper sensor tools. Thus, the trend of slower adoption of PLF seems to reverse in the near future due to the rise of e-literacy across the globe (more rapidly due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic), the reduction of cost of sensors and IT tools, the rise of specialized farming, shortage of skilled labor, etc. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Livestock manure has a high ammonium content that can limit its direct application on soil as a fertiliser in nitrate-vulnerable zones. Treatment technologies that are able to extract ammonium from livestock manure allow it to be concentrated in small volumes, making it cheaper and easier to transport and use as fertiliser in crop areas where there is a deficit of nitrogen. This study proposed using low-temperature vacuum evaporation to treat pig slurry in order to obtain marketable products that can be used as fertilisers and help close the nitrogen cycle. Two different configurations and scales were used. The first was a seven-litre laboratory-scale evaporator complemented with a condenser, a condensate trapper, an acid trap and a vacuum pump operated at −90 kPa vacuum pressure and at three different temperatures: 50.1 ± 0.2 °C, 46.0 ± 0.1 °C and 45.3 ± 1.3 °C. The second, Ammoneva, is an on-farm pilot-scale evaporator (6.4 m3), capable of working in four-hour batches of 1 t of liquid fraction of pig slurry with an operating temperature of 40–45 °C and −80 kPa vacuum pressure. The laboratory-scale evaporator, which features several novel improvements focused on increasing ammonia recovery, showed a higher nitrogen removal efficiency from the liquid fraction of pig slurry than the on-farm pilot plant, achieving 84% at 50.1 °C operation, and recovering most of it in ammonia solution (up to 77% of the initial nitrogen), with 7% of the ammonia not recovered. The Ammoneva pilot plant achieved a treated liquid fraction with 41% of initial nitrogen on average, recovering 15% in the ammonia solution in the acid trap; so, the NH3 gas absorption step needs to be further optimised. However, due to the simplicity of the Ammoneva pilot plant, which is easily placed inside a 20-foot container, and the complete automation of the process, it is suitable as an on-farm treatment for decentralised pig slurry management. The implementation of the novel design developed at laboratory-scale could help further increase recovery efficiencies at the pilot-plant scale. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Advent of industrialization increased the human population significantly and it expanded very rapidly from nineteen sixties. Introduction of mechanization, chemical fertilization and genetic selection in agriculture increased the food production, reduced pestilence and thus improved life expectancy. However, in doing so the natural resources were over utilized, degraded and polluted. The greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic activities increased several folds that resulted into global warming, the consequences of which are being observed in the form of floods, draughts, cloud bursts, melting of glaciers, rising of sea level and loss of species. The soil fertility & water table is decreasing, resistance to pesticides, drugs, antibiotics is increasing and immergence & reemergence of diseases are common. Since the world population by 2050 is anticipated to touch 9 billion that means an increase of 30%. Obviously, the demand for food to feed such a huge population would require 70% increase in the food. With limited resources, depleted soil, polluted atmosphere, disturbed ecosystems and exhausted natural resources, the challenges for food security have amplified. Urbanization, improved incomes and dietary changes will increase the demand for food of animal origin in coming years. Globally animal products provide 67% of the protein and the requirement for meat and milk by 2050 is expected to increase by 73% and 58% respectively. Therefore, to ensure food and nutritional security in coming years, livestock production has to be augmented efficiently, smartly and sustainably. As such, precision, smart livestock farming is inevitable that must integrate all the techniques, skills, knowledge and innovations to produce safe, sufficient, affordable, accessible and sustainable animal food with minimum environmental impacts. With the advancement in robotics, biosensors, artificial intelligence, internet of things and information technology, the farming practices should now be technology driven, smart, need based, automated, productive and integrated. © ASEA.},

	abstract = {The growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors has given rise to a synergistic paradigm known as AIoT, wherein AI functions as the decision-maker and sensors collect information. However, a substantial proportion of AIoT rely on cloud-based AI, which process wirelessly transmitted raw data, increasing power consumption and reducing battery life at sensor nodes. Edge-AI has emerged as a promising alternative, implementing AI directly on sensor nodes, eliminating the need of raw data transmission. Despite its potential, there is a scarcity of hardware architectures optimized for resource-constrained platforms, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), particularly for low-frequency sensors. This work presents a shared-scale integer-only recurrent neural network (RNN) implemented on a Lattice ICE40UP5K FPGA using a resource-minimized time and layer-multiplexed (TLM) hardware architecture. This architecture adopts real-time processing, setting clock frequency to complete a single RNN timestep preceding the next sensor sample, reducing power consumption significantly. Measurements on this FPGA implementing our proposed architecture applied to a pretrained RNN on cow behavior show a power consumption of 360 μ W at a clock frequency of 146 kHz and negligible accuracy loss at 8-bit bitwidth. This finding suggests that our methods lead to the most accurate implementation of animal behavior estimation with a power consumption below 500 μ W on an FPGA. The implementation in Systemverilog and Python code is publicly available, enabling adaptation of the RNN for various tasks involving low-frequency sensors on resource-constrained FPGAs, thereby contributing to the further advancement and democratization of Edge-AI solutions.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Meat, as protein-rich food, provides essential nutrition to humans. Meat consumption is expected to increase by 15% over the next decade, requiring the meat industry to boost its capacity. However, the meat cutting industry's harsh working environment and long-term heavy workload result in a labor shortage. Low-margin and low capacity require innovative processing methods. Hence, some novel automation methods are urgently demanded to meet these challenges. Accompanied by the development of Industry 4.0, robotization and intelligent systems are progressively applied in the meat cutting industry, which can provide a flexible, adaptive, and sustainable processing approach. Scope and approach: The paper selected 50 papers using the systematic literature review method. This paper provides an overview of the current research and commercial applications of cutting robotization from livestock, poultry, and fish in the meat industry. Additionally, intelligent sensing technologies, advanced cutting techniques, and a novel manufacturing concept called the meat factory cell, are emphasized to promote efficiency, scalability, and modularization. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of digital technologies in the meat cutting industry and the focal points of future research aiming to promote cutting robotization. Key findings and conclusions: The meat cutting process can be highly robotized by integrating dexterous cutting robots, advanced sensing techniques, and digital systems, driving the transformation from manual labor to robotic, efficient, and intelligent manufacturing. Consequently, robotization and intelligent digital systems can provide a brand-new manufacturing method to the meat cutting industry and advance the Meat factory 4.0. © 2023},

	abstract = {Body condition scoring is an objective scoring method used to evaluate the health of a cow by determining the amount of subcutaneous fat in a cow. Automated body condition scoring is becoming vital to large commercial dairy farms as it helps farmers score their cows more often and more consistently compared to manual scoring. A common approach to automated body condition scoring is to utilise a CNN-based model trained with data from a depth camera. The approaches presented in this paper make use of three depth cameras placed at different positions near the rear of a cow to train three independent CNNs. Ensemble modelling is used to combine the estimations of the three individual CNN models. The paper aims to test the performance impact of using ensemble modelling with the data from three separate depth cameras. The paper also looks at which of these three cameras and combinations thereof provide a good balance between computational cost and performance. The results of this study show that utilising the data from three depth cameras to train three separate models merged through ensemble modelling yields significantly improved automated body condition scoring accuracy compared to a single-depth camera and CNN model approach. This paper also explored the real-world performance of these models on embedded platforms by comparing the computational cost to the performance of the various models. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Animal husbandry is a vital sector in China’s agriculture sector, contributing to over one-third of its agricultural output, and more than 40% of farmers’ income. However, this industry is vulnerable to risks arising from production and operation, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and market fluctuations. Livestock insurance can help mitigate these risks, but the lack of reliable data on shed environments has hindered its effectiveness. The objective of this study is to propose a livestock shed environmental regulatory platform that utilizes blockchain and the Internet of Things to ensure data authenticity, real-time monitoring, and transparency in the regulatory process. The platform also automates the insurance process, reducing costs and improving efficiency. The proposed platform employs blockchain to ensure data authenticity and devices to monitor and collect real-time environmental data. It also utilizes smart contracts to automate the insurance process, from negotiating and signing contracts to making insurance claims. The system’s design rationale, architecture, and implementation are detailed. The proposed platform has been implemented and currently manages over 300,000 livestock animals with more than 350,000 insurance contracts signed. The use of blockchain and the Internet of Things has ensured data authenticity, real-time monitoring, and transparency in the regulatory process, while the automation of the insurance process has reduced costs and improved efficiency. The proposed livestock shed environmental regulatory platform has the potential to improve the effectiveness of livestock insurance in China by addressing the critical issue of data reliability. The use of blockchain and the Internet of Things has enabled real-time monitoring, data authenticity, and transparency in the regulatory process, while the automation of the insurance process has improved efficiency and reduced costs.

	abstract = {Early indicator traits for swine reproduction and longevity support economical selection decision-making. Activity is a key variable impacting a sow’s herd life and productivity. Early-life activities could contribute to farrowing traits including gestation length (GL), number born alive (NBA), and number weaned (NW). Beginning at 20 weeks of age, 480 gilts were video recorded for 7 consecutive days and processed using the NUtrack system. Activity traits included angle rotated (radians), average speed (m/s), distance traveled (m), time spent eating (s), lying lateral (s), lying sternal (s), standing (s), and sitting (s). Final daily activity values were averaged across the period under cameras. Parity one data were collected for all gilts considered. Data were analyzed using linear regression models (R version 4.0.2). GL was significantly impacted by angle rotated (p = 0.03), average speed (p = 0.07), distance traveled (p = 0.05), time spent lying lateral (p = 0.003), and lying sternal (0.02). NBA was significantly impacted by time spent lying lateral (p = 0.01), lying sternal (p = 0.07), and time spent sitting (p = 0.08). NW was significantly impacted by time spent eating (p = 0.09), time spent lying lateral (p = 0.04), and time spent sitting (p = 0.007). This analysis suggests early-life gilt activities are associated with sow productivity traits of importance. Further examination of the link between behaviors compiled utilizing NUtrack and reproductive traits is necessitated to further isolate behavioral differences for potential use in selection decisions. © 2023 by the authors.},

We focus on the novel application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in long-distance livestock transportation, particularly in livestock enumeration and identification for precise traceability. Technological advancements in identifying behavioral patterns in ‘shy feeder’ cows and real-time weight monitoring enhance the accuracy of long-haul livestock transportation. These innovations offer benefits such as improved animal welfare standards, reduced supply chain inaccuracies, and increased operational productivity, expanding market access and enhancing global competitiveness. However, these technologies present challenges, including individual animal customization, economic analysis, data security, privacy, technological adaptability, training, stakeholder engagement, and sustainability concerns. These challenges intertwine with broader ethical considerations around animal treatment, data misuse, and the environmental impacts.

Agricultural segments, such as crop and livestock monitoring, crop/plant classification, yield prediction, weed detection, automatic harvesting, early detection, and prevention of diseases are being served for efficient, cost-effective process monitoring with increased profitability. With the remarkable development in recent decades, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) based remote sensing technologies have gained rapid proliferation and exploitation in precision agriculture. Consequently, over the past decades, researchers have explored the capabilities of UAVs for real-time imagery data acquisition and processing through powerful Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to optimize agricultural process management. Being a prevalent research domain of high-tech field with constant advancement, there is a need for systematic review to recapitulate the contemporary literature and reveal the domain's intellectual structure. This systematic literature review (SLR) research has methodically scrutinized 214 peer reviewed articles on the concerned domain that are published in ranked journals and conferences over the past 14 years. Several pressing dimensions are investigated, including, the feasibility assessment of the UAVs in precision agriculture, determine the impact of imaging modalities and imagery datasets in relation to agricultural applications, categorically evaluate the UAV configuration and offer detailed scrutiny of AI methods in relation to real-time control, decision making and action performance in agricultural applications. Alongside, the taxonomy of crops across the world is documented for which UAV is utilized. Finally, the main challenges and directions of future research along the track is presented. © 2023},

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed many great successes of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) applications in agricultural systems, including weed control, plant disease diagnosis, agricultural robotics, and precision livestock management. However, a notable limitation of these ML/DL models lies in their reliance on large-scale labeled datasets for training, with their performance closely tied to the quantity and quality of available labeled data. The process of collecting, processing, and labeling such datasets is both expensive and time-consuming, primarily due to escalating labor costs. This challenge has sparked substantial interest among researchers and practitioners in the development of label-efficient ML/DL methods tailored for agricultural applications. In fact, there are more than 50 papers on developing and applying deep-learning-based label-efficient techniques to address various agricultural problems since 2016, which motivates the authors to provide a timely and comprehensive review of recent label-efficient ML/DL methods in agricultural applications. To this end, a principled taxonomy is first developed to organize these methods according to the degree of supervision, including weak supervision (i.e., active learning and semi-/weakly- supervised learning), and no supervision (i.e., un-/self- supervised learning), supplemented by representative state-of-the-art label-efficient ML/DL methods. In addition, a systematic review of various agricultural applications exploiting these label-efficient algorithms, such as precision agriculture, plant phenotyping, and postharvest quality assessment, is presented. Finally, the current problems and challenges are discussed, as well as future research directions.

	abstract = {The United States plays a fundamental role in meeting the global demand for beef. Environmental concerns and volatile weather conditions have increasingly impacted beef production in recent years. To mitigate these issues, the cattle industry has begun to integrate sophisticated technological solutions into production processes. Utilization of these technologies, known as precision livestock farming (PLF) include the use of sensors, robotics, and big data analytics. PLF can enhance production and reduce illness-related losses by providing real-time insights for whole farm operations through the integration and analysis of generated data. PLF technology is still in the early stages of development and implementation, thus little is known about the factors impacting producer adoption in beef production. The objective of this study is to examine factors affecting adoption of PFL, particularly big data technology, in beef cattle production. Results of a binary probit analysis indicate that herd size and prior adoption of sensor-based technology positively affected the adoption of big data technology by U.S. beef producers.

Data from riverine buffaloes (n = 207) under the CIDR-Synch-hCG protocol were analyzed. Buffaloes were administered with Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) with insertion of CIDR on Day 0. Prostaglandin (PGF2α) was given on Day 7 with the removal of CIDR. hCG was given on Day 9, and AI was performed on Day 10. Follicle measurements by ultrasonography were done on Days 0, 7, and 10, and follicle sizes on those days were categorized into I, II, and III. Estrus signs were taken on the day of AI. The pregnancy diagnosis was done on Day 30-35 post-AI. The average size of follicles in Category III is significantly higher than those of Categories I and II, regardless of the Days of the protocol. Pregnancy is significantly (P<0.001) associated with Pre-Ovulatory Follicle (POF) size and uterine tonicity on the Day of AI but not with follicle sizes on Days 0 and 7, nor with mucus discharge discharge (P>0.05). The overall pregnancy rate is 44.44% while performing AI with POF size ≥12.0 mm increased the probability of pregnancy rate to 56.25%. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a follicle size-based CIDR-Synch-hCG protocol providing new fertility indicators to improve FTAI efficiency in buffaloes with huge application in other livestock species. © 2024 Atabay et al.},

	abstract = {Animal behavior, as one of the most crucial indicators of animal health and welfare, provides rich insights into animal physical and mental states. Automated animal activity recognition (AAR) allows caretakers to monitor animal behavioral variations in real time, significantly reducing workloads and costs in veterinary clinics and promoting livestock management efficiency. With recent advances in sensing technologies and smart computing techniques, automated AAR has been increasingly studied, and tremendous successes have been achieved. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of recent research on AAR based on wearable sensors and deep learning algorithms. First, the commonly used sensor types and frequently studied animal species and activities are described. Then, an extensive overview of deep learning-based methods for wearable sensor-aided AAR is presented, according to the taxonomy of deep learning algorithms. We also provide a comprehensive list of publicly available datasets collected via wearable sensor-aided AAR over the past five years. This list can serve as a valuable resource for readers who wish to further explore the field of AAR. In addition, we discuss potential challenges associated with the development of deep learning models for AAR and suggest potential solutions and future research directions for these challenges. In conclusion, this review work provides rich inspiration for the future advancement of robust AAR systems based on wearable sensors and deep learning techniques. When combined with qualitative assessments of veterinary specialists, the accurate and quantitative results obtained by automated AAR systems hold the potential to significantly improve animal health and welfare. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Italian and international outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), particularly in densely populated poultry areas (DPPAs), have increased over the past few decades. These emerging risks, which endanger both human and animal health and the entire poultry industry, can be effectively limited by biosecurity measures implemented at human-animal food chain interfaces. Some problems, however, persist in the application of these measures on the part of poultry farmers, prompting the need to explore those aspects and causes that limit their implementation. Material and methods: A qualitative approach was selected for the study and a semi-structured interview technique was applied to collect data among turkey farmers (n = 29) working in the north-east of Italy. The aim of this technique was to gather data on farms in order to understand the biosecurity practices adopted and the reasons for and impediments to farmer implementation, or lack thereof. This article presents and discusses the main data collected. Results: The study revealed that farmers were familiar with the biosecurity measures necessary to contain avian influenza (AI) and other poultry diseases; personal disinfection and animal isolation practices were particularly prominent. Based on the reported procedures, managerial, economic, and psychosocial factors were among the barriers behind the failure to implement biosecurity measures. These obstacles were variously intertwined and associated with the different action settings. In particular management factors, such as lack of time to apply the rules and difficulties contingent on the farm's structural characteristics, mediate the application of biosecurity measures. In terms of communication channels, the company, particularly its technicians, proved to be the primary source of information for farmers in case of emergencies, as well as the primary source of information on the application of biosecurity measures. However, other sources of information were indicated, such as word of mouth among farmers or other non-institutional figures (relatives and acquaintances). Conclusions: What emerged, was the need to improve not only the biosecurity management skills, but also to implement forms of cooperation among the various key stakeholders in the poultry sector. The information presented in this pilot study needs to be discussed among competent authorities, public and company veterinarians, company technicians, and farmers. Furthermore, this information will help in participatory co-planning of risk prevention and communication strategies to implement a long-term, sustainable, effective approach to address future epidemic emergencies. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The domestic buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), also known as water buffalo, comprises two sub-species the River buffalo (B. bubalis ssp. bubalis; 50 chromosomes) and the Swamp buffalo (ssp. carabanensis; 48 chromosomes). Domestic buffaloes are a globally significant livestock species. In South Asia, the River buffalo is a primary source of milk and meat and has a very important role in food security. The River buffalo also supports high-value, differentiated food production in Europe and the Americas. The Swamp buffalo is an important draft animal and a source of food in Southeast Asia and East Asia. The growing importance of buffaloes requires that they undergo an accelerated rate of genetic gain for efficiency of production, product quality, and sustainability. This will involve the increased use of assisted reproduction. The initial application of reproductive technology in buffaloes had variable success as it relied on the adoption of procedures developed for cattle. This included artificial insemination (AI), sperm cryopreservation, and embryo technologies such as cloning and in vitro embryo production (IVEP). Reproductive technology has been progressively refined in buffaloes, and today, the success of AI and IVEP is comparable to cattle. Ovarian follicular superstimulation (superovulation) combined with in vivo embryo production results in low embryo recovery in buffaloes and has limited practical application. The contribution of elite female buffaloes to future genetic improvement will therefore rely mainly on oocyte pickup and IVEP. This will include IVEP from females before puberty to reduce generation intervals. This review provides for the first time a clear chronology on the development, adoption, and impact, of assisted reproduction in domestic buffaloes. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Automated collection of accelerometer data and subsequent machine learning modeling are prevalent combined methods for animal behavior recognition. However, there is a lack of customized tools for user-friendly machine learning model development. Meanwhile, existing models in previous research could not be directly used for behavior interpretation. The objective of this study was to design and develop a tool for customized machine learning model development and animal behavior analysis using triaxial accelerometer data. A graphical user interface was programmed with Python and saved in a public repository for open access. The interface mainly consists of pages of ‘Manage Project’, ‘Preprocess Data’, ‘Develop Models’, and ‘Analyze Behavior’. An open dataset containing triaxial accelerometer data of six beef cattle was used to test the developed interface. The main results show that users can customize appropriate machine learning models for behavior analytics through several mouse clicks on the interface. A total of 15 models can be selected and trained to determine an optimal one, and model performance can be optimized by adjusting parameters of window size, step size, and training-to-validation ratio. Data imbalance can be solved by merging minority classes into one. The newly developed model has the capacity to analyze overall behavior time budget, statistics (e.g., mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation) of each behavior duration, and frequency of behavior sequences. The tool is supportive for automated animal behavior analytics critical to enhancing animal welfare, housing environment, genetics selection, and flock management. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Although robots have pervaded many industrial sectors and domestic environments, the experiments in the food sectors are limited to pick-and-place operations and meat processing while we are assisting new attention in gastronomy. Given the great performances of the robots, there would be many other intriguing applications to explore which could usher the transition to precision food manufacturing. This review wants open thoughts and opinions on the use of robots in different food operations. First, we reviewed the recent advances in common applications - e.g. novel sensors, end-effectors, and robotic cutting. Then, we analyzed the use of robots in other operations such as cleaning, mixing/kneading, dough manipulation, precision dosing/cooking, and additive manufacturing. Finally, the most recent improvements of robotics in gastronomy with their use in restaurants/bars and domestic environments, are examined. The comprehensive analyses and the critical discussion highlighted the needs of further scientific understanding and exploitation activities aimed to fill the gap between the laboratory-scale results and the validation in the relevant environment. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Giardia duodenalis is considered as one of the important common protozoa between humans and animals in the intestine, which has eight groups (A-H) in different hosts. Studies have shown that the assemblages A, B, and E can infect livestock. In this study, the prevalence and genotype of Giardia duodenalis was determined by polymerase chain reaction of ssu-rRNA gene and by performing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) on glutamate dehydrogenase gene of the parasite in water buffalo (n = 60) from Iraq. Based on the results, prevalence of G. duodenalis infection in water buffalo was estimated 25 % (n = 15), and according to age groups, higher infection group was 40% at ≤ 6 months, followed by > 6-12 months, 1-2 years, >2 years which showed 26.6%, 13.3% and 20.1%, respectively. The result of distribution of genotypes of G. duodenalis showed that assemblages AI and E were recorded in water buffalo isolates by 60 % and 40 %. Infection of assemblage AI was reported in buffaloes under 12 months. The present study determined that G. duodenalis is highly prevalent in water buffalo, and is involved in creating a zoonotic disease for giardiasis in Iraq. Due to the direct relationship between food and public health, as well as the influence of geographic and host conditions on the spread and pathogenicity, it is necessary to further investigate different genotypes and their common aspects between humans and livestock. © The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The development of local bull in many regions is currently leading to the development of local bulls and Indonesia is no exception, especially in South Sulawesi Province. One of local bulls in which developed for approximately last ten years is Bali-polled bull. Thus, the selection of polled bulls is crucial, mainly in modern livestock management. The aims of this study to identify sperms post-thawing quality and proteomic plasma semen as fertility performance in Bali-polled bull. The utilization of Bali-horned bulls as a point of reference was necessary to achieve this aim. The semen samples from Bali-horned and Bali-polled bulls were obtained twice weekly using an artificial vagina. The semen samples were immediately sent to the laboratory for processing. Parameters measured were sperm motility, abnormality, viability, acrosome integrity, and membrane integrity. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS/ MS) analysis was used to assess the confirmation profile protein of seminal plasma. The conception rate from artificial insemination was used to determine the fertility rate (AI). This investigation revealed that the quality of the sperms from Bali-polled bulls and Bali-horned bulls did not substantially change after thawing (p > 0.05). However, sperm acrosome integrity was considerably (p < 0.05) higher in Bali-polled bulls than in Bali-horned bulls. In the profiling protein seminal plasma, ZPBP protein expression was found in the Bali-polled bull which was not found in the Balihorned bull. Bali-polled bulls and Bali-horned bulls did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) in terms of fertility rate on conception rate. In conclusion, sperms post-thawing quality of Bali-polled bull have a good category according SNI 4869-1:2017 and proteomic seminal plasma of Bali-polled bull has a protein profile linked to reproductive function. © 2023 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: High milk production and excellent fertility is a dream of livestock owners. The major reproductive disorders which lead to decrease the productivity and reproductive ability of farm animals is postpartum anestrous. Recently, kisspeptin was reported as game changer in the animal reproduction. Kisspeptin increases the number of follicles at wave emergence, oestrus response rate and duration of oestrus. Thus, indicating its potentiality for induction of oestrus in anestrous animals. Methods: The present study was conducted to compare the efficacy of Ovsynch and kisspeptin protocol and need of fortification for treatment of postpartum anestrous. Fifty postpartum anestrous cows were selected. The animals were divided into four treatment groups (10 cows in each) and treated with Ovsynch (Group I), Ovsynch fortified with mineral mixture (MM) and bypass fat (BPF) (Group II), kisspeptin (Group III) and kisspeptin fortified with MM +BPF (Group IV). The remaining 10 cows served as control (Group V). The oestrus response was recorded on the basis of behavioral signs, physical signs and clinico-gynaecological changes. The blood was collected following treatment for hormonal estimation. The pregnancy was confirmed on day 45 post AI using ultrasound. Result: The oestrus response was pronounced in Ovsynch as compared to kisspeptin groups. Further, fortification has enhanced the response. The serum oestrogen concentration increased following treatment and was significantly high on day of onset of oestrus with highest concentration in group II. The results indicate Ovsynch distinguishly succeeded in addressing postpartum anestrus with fortification enhances fertility response. However, kisspeptin also emerged as a potent candidate for the resumption of cyclicity. © 2023 Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The current tools that allow the application of precision agriculture in livestock systems are undergoing growing diffusion. Given the significant share of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the livestock sector, this study investigates the potential contribution of precision agriculture technologies to animal farming sustainability, particularly when considering alternative energy sources. The research compared two intensive dairy farms in the upper Po Valley (conventional farm - CF - and precision agriculture farm - PAF) using the life cycle assessment approach, considering as declared unit 1 kg of fat protein corrected milk, and aiming to (i) assess the main environmental impact categories for precision and conventional farming; (ii) compare different allocation modes (reference, mass, economic). In the reference mode all the burdens and all the environmental impacts of the farming system are allocated to the main product, which is the milk. The chosen impact categories were: global warming potential, acidification and eutrophication potentials, non-renewable energy, agricultural land occupation and fossil depletion. Based on the results, in the case of reference allocation, PAF impacts are lower than those from CF for all the impact categories except for global warming potential. When considering mass and economic allocations, the impacts of PAF and CF show the same behaviour for the various impact categories; however, the calculated equivalents place PAF at an increased sustainability level than CF. Therefore, precision agriculture technologies in animal farming are viable cues for the sustainability of the zootechnical sector and are worth being deepened in future studies focusing on the outcomes of zootechnical automation. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: The red meat processing industry has a harsh work environment where tasks performed in abattoirs are physically and mentally demanding. In addition, the high financial costs associated with employing skilled labour, the shortage of such workers, and the rise in worldwide meat consumption, there has been a growing push towards integrating automation as a potential solution for the industry. Scope and approach: This paper describes the complexities of implementing robotics technology in red meat processing. The complexity when processing deformable natural meat mediums is significantly sensitive to the variations of workpieces caused by mechanical properties, physical shape and the position of tissues. These differences hinder conventional robotic systems from succeeding. Experimental and commercial robotic systems in red meat processing are shown to perform cutting tasks in the deboning room, whose systems capabilities are limited by executing cuts requiring little to no adaptability during the process. The review shows that X-ray, optical probes, and ultrasonic are the most effective sensing technologies in determining the cutting trajectories prior to the task. Some experimental systems utilised tactile sensing to follow more complex cutting paths but have not yet produced a commercially viable product. The evaluation of these sensing technologies' applicability to guide a robotic system in real-time is critical to tackling more complex cuts. Key findings and conclusions: A combination of preoperative scanning and real-time perception for adaptive control is recommended to automate tasks in red meat cutting. Also, it is recommended that to fully automate the meat cutting process, a gradual approach should be taken by shifting abattoirs by first utilising assistive technologies such as cobots, exoskeletons augmented reality, and virtual reality. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are revolutionizing the globe with their sensing technologies. This initiative aims to design and deploy a cattle health monitoring system (CHMS) for the agriculture sector for the well-being of livestock and the eradication of hunger. The production and consumption of all dairy and meat products can only be conducted responsibly if the health of the source animal is protected. In this regard, WSNs, a component of the Internet-of-things (IoT) system, can be utilized for monitoring cow health due to their adaptability and portability, which enables them to be applied to expansive domains such as cattle healthcare. The integration of IoT and artificial intelligence enables the prediction of livestock illnesses. The primary purpose of this proposed system is to forecast cattle diseases utilizing real-time data from non-invasive body-area sensors and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and to display the expected results to authorized personnel via a web application. Popular authentication schemes are used in this system as it is susceptible to hacking and requires robust network security to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its resources. The presented results validates the accuracy of the proposed novel system for cow diseases prediction that is approximately 98 percent.

	abstract = {Precision agriculture in the realm of the Internet of Things is characterized by the collection of data from multiple sensors deployed on the farm. These data present a spatial, temporal, and semantic characterization, which further complicates the performance in the management and implementation of models and repositories. In turn, the lack of standards is reflected in insufficient interoperability between management solutions and other non-native services in the framework. In this paper, an innovative system for spatio-temporal semantic data management is proposed. It includes a data query system that allows farmers and users to solve queries daily, as well as feed decision-making, monitoring, and task automation solutions. In the proposal, a solution is provided to ensure service interoperability and is validated against two European smart farming platforms, namely AFarCloud and DEMETER. For the evaluation and validation of the proposed framework, a neural network is implemented, fed through STSDaMaS for training and validation, to provide accurate forecasts for the harvest and baling of forage legume crops for livestock feeding. As a result of the evaluation for the training and execution of neural networks, high performance on complex spatio-temporal semantic queries is exposed. The paper concludes with a distributed framework for managing complex spatio-temporal semantic data by offering service interoperability through data integration to external agricultural data models.

	abstract = {Non-invasive measures have a critical role in precision livestock and poultry farming as they can reduce animal stress and provide continuous monitoring. Animal activity can reflect physical and mental states as well as health conditions. If any problems are detected, an early warning will be provided for necessary actions. The objective of this study was to identify avian diseases by using thermal-image processing and machine learning. Four groups of 14-day-old Ross 308 Broilers (20 birds per group) were used. Two groups were infected with one of the following diseases: Newcastle Disease (ND) and Avian Influenza (AI), and the other two were considered control groups. Thermal images were captured every 8 h and processed with MATLAB. After de-noising and removing the background, 23 statistical features were extracted, and the best features were selected using the improved distance evaluation method. Support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were developed as classifiers. Results indicated that the former classifier outperformed the latter for disease classification. The Dempster–Shafer evidence theory was used as the data fusion stage if neither ANN nor SVM detected the diseases with acceptable accuracy. The final SVM-based framework achieved 97.2% and 100% accuracy for classifying AI and ND, respectively, within 24 h after virus infection. The proposed method is an innovative procedure for the timely identification of avian diseases to support early intervention. © 2023 by the authors.},

Currently, there are no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments for humans. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro efficacy of chemical compounds targeting the Gc fusion mechanism. These compounds were identified through virtual screening of millions of commercially available small molecules using a structure-based artificial intelligence bioactivity predictor. In our experiments, a pretreatment with small molecule compounds revealed that 3 out of 94 selected compounds effectively inhibited the replication of the Rift Valley fever virus MP-12 strain in Vero cells. As anticipated, these compounds did not impede viral RNA replication when administered three hours after infection. However, significant inhibition of viral RNA replication occurred upon viral entry when cells were pretreated with these small molecules. Furthermore, these compounds exhibited significant inhibition against Arumowot virus, another phlebovirus, while showing no antiviral effects on tick-borne bandaviruses. Our study validates AI-based virtual high throughput screening as a rational approach for identifying effective antiviral candidates for Rift Valley fever virus and other bunyaviruses. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution is a global diffuse threat, especially considering its fragmentation into microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). Since the contamination of the aquatic environment is already well studied, most studies have now focused on the soil. Moreover, the number of studies on the exposure routes and toxic effects of MNPs in humans is continuously increasing. Although MNPs can cause inflammation, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and immune toxicity in livestock animals, which can accumulate ingested/inhaled plastic particles and transfer them to humans through the food chain, research on this topic is still lacking. In considering farm animals as the missing link between soil/plant contamination and human health effects, this paper aims to describe their importance as carriers and vectors of MNP contamination. As research on this topic is in its early stages, there is no standard method to quantify the amount and the characteristics of MNPs in different matrices. Therefore, the creation of a common database where researchers can report data on MNP characteristics and quantification methods could be helpful for both method standardization and the future training of an AI tool for predicting the most abundant/dangerous polymer(s), thus supporting policy decisions to reduce plastic pollution and perfectly fitting with One Health principles. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Due to increasing herd sizes and automation on dairy farms there is an important need for automated monitoring of cow production, health, and welfare. Despite much progress in automatic monitoring techniques, there is still a need to integrate data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive overview and accurate diagnosis of a cow's state. To aid the technological development of data integration, a prototype of an open and customizable automatic system that integrates data from multiple sensors relating to barn environment and cow behaviour was developed. The system integrates data from sensors that measure barn climate (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed), air quality (e.g., CO2 concentration), water use and temperature, the moisture and temperature of the litter and cow behaviour (e.g., lying, eating, ruminating). An external weather system and video recording system are also included. The system's architecture consists of four main elements: sensors, nodes, gateways, and backend. The data are recorded by sensors, then locally processed on custom-developed sensor nodes, and then transmitted via radio channels to local gateways that combine the data from multiple nodes and transmit them to distributed digital storage (“the cloud”) via a 3G/4G cellular network. On the cloud, the data are further processed and stored in a database. The data are then presented to the user continuously and in real time on a dashboard that can be accessed via the internet. In the design of the local wireless network, care was taken to avoid data packet collision and thus to minimize data loss. To test the system's performance, the system was installed and operated on three commercial dairy cattle farms for one year. The system provided high data stability with minimal loss and outliers, showing that the system is reliable and suitable for long term application on commercial dairy farms. The system's architecture, communication network, and data processing and visualization applications form an open framework for research and development purposes, allowing it to be customized and fine-tuned before being deployed as a management assistant on commercial dairy farms. Missing elements that should be added in the future are the integration of the data from the milking parlour and cow identification. Algorithms to integrate information from multiple sensors can be added to provide a comprehensive system that monitors all aspects related to cow welfare, health, and production automatically, remotely and in real time, thereby supporting farmers in important management decision-making. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Plant-based proteins are gaining popularity because of their appeal to vegetarians and vegans, alignment with scientific and regulatory recommendations, and the environmental impact associated with livestock production. Several techniques are employed for the separation, isolation, and purification of plant-based proteins including membrane-based separation, diafiltration, centrifugation, chromatography, electrophoresis, micellar precipitation, and isoelectric precipitation. Despite decades of application, these techniques still have some limitations such as scale-up challenges, high solvent consumption, chemical/biological disposal, and the possibility of protein loss during precipitation or elution. Membrane separation processes are the most effective purification/concentration technology in the production of plant-based protein isolates and concentrates due to their selective separation, simple operational conditions, and easy automation. Membrane separation processes yielded products with higher protein content compared to isoelectric precipitation, and all concentrates presented good functional properties with expected variability among different legumes. This review critically focuses on the membrane technology advances and challenges for the purification of plant-based protein isolates. This study also highlights the plant-based diet trend, the market, composition, and the protein isolate of the faba bean, in addition to the emerging technologies for the elimination of antinutritional compounds. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Synchronous lying may be an indicator of positive welfare in dairy cows. However, little is known about whether farms differ in the level of lying synchrony and how consistent this is within a farm. Moreover, the level of synchrony may vary within the day. Accelerometers used for estrus detection of cows enable continuous monitoring of synchronous lying of herds. We studied the level, timing and duration of synchronous lying in 8 Holstein Friesian or Holstein dairy herds across 1 year, in relation to grazing and milking management (robotic milking, 2x and 3x daily milking). In ‘winter’ months (November-March), herds were housed; in ‘summer’ months (May-September), 6 of 8 herds had access to pasture for 5–8 h per day, the other 2 herds were full-time housed. April and October were excluded because of variable management. Herds had 0.9–1.4 cubicles available per cow. After cleaning individual accelerometer data, herd average lying time was computed per 15-min (900 s) interval. An interval was defined as synchronous lying when the herd average lying time > 540 or > 630 s (i.e. assuming 60% or 70% of the herd was lying). Daily synchronous lying time was defined as the number of synchronous intervals × 15 min. A general linear model was used to assess effects of farm, season, and their interaction on synchronous lying time per day; with Tukey-adjusted pairwise comparisons. Correlations were made per farm per season to assess the association between total daily lying time and synchronous lying time. Across all herds and calendar days, the highest level of synchrony reached was on average 78%. Most synchronous lying occurred between 2AM and 6AM, though this was not true for all farms. Synchronous lying occurred least between 4 and 8 PM. Across farms, average synchronous (60% threshold) lying time per day was 5.9 h in summer (range: 2.7 – 7.9 h) and 5.5 h in winter (range: 1.6 – 9.1 h). In 3 out of 6 farms with grazing, synchronous lying time was higher in summer due to occurrence of synchronous lying during periods with pasture access. On 2 farms, synchronous lying time was higher in winter than summer due to increased synchronous lying at night. Across farms, average daily lying time and synchronous lying time generally showed moderate correlations. Monitoring synchronous lying in dairy herds using accelerometers was feasible, and 24-h synchrony patterns seemed consistent within farms. Its validity as a positive or negative welfare indicator requires further study. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper pioneers a novel exploration of environmental impacts in livestock farming, focusing on pig farming’s intersection with climate change and sustainability. It emphasizes the transformative potential of data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies, specifically the Internet of Things (IoT) and multimodal data analysis, in promoting equitable and sustainable food systems. The study observes five pigs aged 86 to 108 days using a tripartite sensor that records heart rate, respiration rate, and accelerometer data. The unique experimental design alternates between periods of isolation during feeding and subsequent pairing, enabling the investigation of stress-induced changes. Key inquiries include discerning patterns in heart rate data during isolation versus paired settings, fluctuations in respiration rates, and behavioral shifts induced by isolation or pairing. The study also explores the potential detection of gait abnormalities, correlations between pigs’ age and their gait or activity patterns, and the evolution of pigs’ walking abilities with age. The paper scrutinizes accelerometer data to detect activity changes when pigs are paired, potentially indicating increased stress or aggression. It also examines the adaptation of pigs to alternating isolation and pairing over time and how their heart rate, respiration rate, and activity data reflect this process. The study considers other significant variables, such as time of day and isolation duration, affecting the pigs’ physiological parameters. Sensor data are further utilized to identify behavioral patterns during periods of feeding, isolation, or pairing. In conclusion, this study harnesses IoT and multimodal data analysis in a groundbreaking approach to pig welfare research. It underscores the compelling potential of technology to inform about overall pig welfare, particularly stress levels and gait quality, and the power of data-driven insights in fostering equitable, healthy, and environmentally conscious livestock production systems. © 2023 by the author.},

	abstract = {The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in animal husbandry, particularly in pig interaction recognition (PIR), offers a transformative approach to enhancing animal welfare, promoting sustainability, and bolstering climate resilience. This innovative methodology not only mitigates labor costs but also significantly reduces stress levels among domestic pigs, thereby diminishing the necessity for constant human intervention. However, the raw PIR datasets often encompass irrelevant porcine features, which pose a challenge for the accurate interpretation and application of these datasets in real-world scenarios. The majority of these datasets are derived from sequential pig imagery captured from video recordings, and an unregulated shuffling of data often leads to an overlap of data samples between training and testing groups, resulting in skewed experimental evaluations. To circumvent these obstacles, we introduced a groundbreaking solution—the Semi-Shuffle-Pig Detector (SSPD) for PIR datasets. This novel approach ensures a less biased experimental output by maintaining the distinctiveness of testing data samples from the training datasets and systematically discarding superfluous information from raw images. Our optimized method significantly enhances the true performance of classification, providing unbiased experimental evaluations. Remarkably, our approach has led to a substantial improvement in the isolation after feeding (IAF) metric by 20.2% and achieved higher accuracy in segregating IAF and paired after feeding (PAF) classifications exceeding 92%. This methodology, therefore, ensures the preservation of pertinent data within the PIR system and eliminates potential biases in experimental evaluations. As a result, it enhances the accuracy and reliability of real-world PIR applications, contributing to improved animal welfare management, elevated food safety standards, and a more sustainable and climate-resilient livestock industry. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Animal husbandry is ever-increasing in artificial intelligence (AI) at present, in terms of scale, informatization, and refinement. Collective cattle farms can be expected to gradually replace the small-scale mode, such as individual farming. An important challenge has posed on the automated management in animal husbandry. It is very necessary to accurately identify the livestock population in the large-scale grazing and breeding, in order to determine the quantity and then update the population information in real-time. However, it is very difficult for the scale and automation of livestock detection, due to the complex environment in the pastoral areas, which was often obstructed by trees, sunlight, and sandstorms. The current object algorithms often encounter missed and error detections, even leading to monitoring accurately. In this article, a livestock detection called LDHorNet (livestock detection HorNet) was proposed using the YOLOV5s object detection network. Firstly, a HorNB module was designed to detect the small targets in the long-distance and complex environments. The recursive gated convolution in the HorNB was used to extend the second-order interactions in self-attention to any order. As such, the C3 module was then replaced in the Backbone and Neck sections, in order to improve the performance of the network model. The high-order spatial information interaction was realized without introducing significant additional calculations. The better performance of the improved model was achieved to understand the relationship between different targets in the image, and then better capture the spatial structure and contextual information between targets. The accuracy of detection was also enhanced to locate and detect the small targets. Secondly, the gradient accumulation was utilized to decrease the variance of gradient, in order to enhance both the stability of the model and the efficiency of feature extraction. The CBAM (convolutional block attention module) attention mechanism was also embedded in the Neck section of the network structure to better capture the key information in the image. The detection accuracy and attention weight of small targets were improved to effectively solve the interference of light, wind and sand, noise, and livestock motion blur on livestock detection in complex pastoral environments. At the same time, there was a decrease in the missed detection, due to overlapping occlusion of livestock in the pastoral areas. The repulsion loss function was utilized to handle the overlapping occlusion. There was an enhancement in the recall and accuracy of the model. Finally, accurate detection was achieved in the complex scenes, such as the complex lighting and environmental interference. The experimental results show that the LDHorNet model shared the better performance and high accuracy, with a Precision and Recall of 95.24% and 88.87%, respectively, and with the mAP_0.5 and mAP_0.5:0.95 of 94.11% and 77.01%, respectively. The precision of the improved model increased by 2.83, 2.93, and 9.79 percentage points, respectively, compared with the YOLOv5s, YOLOv8s, and YOLOv7 Tiny, and the Recall increased by 6.66, 4.95, and 13.42 percentage points, respectively, mAP_0.5 increased by 3.98, 3.4, and 10.78 percentage points, respectively, with mAP_0.5:0.95 increased by 12.46, 5.26, and 20.97 percentage points, respectively. This network performed the best to detect the livestock in the small targets and occlusion scenes. Therefore, this model can provide a strong reference for livestock detection under large-scale grazing conditions. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All rights reserved.},

One solution proposed to address such challenges is agricultural robotics, and in particular, autonomous systems for crop and livestock monitoring, disease management, and harvesting. However, several ethical challenges emerging from the potential use of agricultural robotics have been identified, leading to calls for responsible innovation of the technology. To examine how these ethical challenges are being addressed by the sector, it is important to understand how the responsible innovation principles of anticipation, inclusion, reflexivity, and responsiveness are being integrated into innovation of these robots. In this study, we focused on the principle of inclusion, conducting semi-structured interviews with key members of the UK agricultural robotics sector. A thematic analysis of the results showed inclusion of some stakeholder groups, the use of networks for stakeholder identification, and an emphasis on stakeholder engagement to facilitate developer education, technical specifications, and end-user confidence. However, the analysis also identified an absence of engagement with other stakeholder groups, and limited focus on stakeholder engagement to explore social and ethical issues. This study recommends a future focus on how inclusive anticipatory exercises could facilitate more responsible innovation of autonomous agricultural robotics.  © 2023 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {The combination of computer vision with deep learning has become a popular tool for automation of labor-intensive monitoring tasks in modern livestock farming. However, uncontrolled and varying environmental conditions, which usually prevail in farmhouses, influence the performance of vision-based applications. Image quality can be reduced, for instance by occlusions, illumination or motions of the animals, which can influence the reliability of those applications. To address this issue, this study proposes an approach for the identification of uncertain neural-network predictions to improve the overall prediction quality. It proposes the direct quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on the one hand and indirect estimation of uncertainty through the prediction of occlusions on the other hand. Our approach simultaneously integrates the different methods into an end-to-end trainable instance segmentation and regression model. The objective of this study was to first investigate how well the different measures can quantify the uncertainty of a prediction by comparing them to human uncertainty assessments. Then, it was analyzed whether the uncertainty estimations are capable to identify and reject erroneous predictions by evaluating the correlation between the predictive error and the uncertainty estimations. Finally, individual predictions were rejected based on the estimated uncertainties to analyze the effect on the overall accuracy. As a use-case, the developed methods were applied to the prediction of plumage conditions of chickens but also examined in a separate domain. The results showed that the outputs of our approaches for the estimation of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty correlate to the predictive error of the model, and lead to increased performance when uncertain predictions are rejected. In contrast, the indirect method to identify occluded samples did not serve as a reliable indicator for uncertainty and could therefore not be used to improve the accuracy of the model outputs. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Dairy farmers are losing faith in the sector as cows suffer from a range of health issues, disease outbreaks that are unpredictable, and expensive breeding expenses. As a consequence, farmers must use efficient technology techniques for cow health monitoring in order to enhance milk output. This study looked at a range of wireless sensor-based automated dairy cow health monitoring systems. The fundamental purpose of wireless sensor network (WSN) based smart surveillance systems in agricultural optimization is to follow the health of dairy cows on a continual basis. This monitoring gadget must be installed in both local and remote farm areas so that interested farmers may monitor their cattle's movements throughout the day from several places. The data collected by the automated system would be kept in a database. Farmers may then obtain data using farm automation to execute effective farm management techniques. Furthermore, WSN is a low-cost device created exclusively for identifying illnesses in dairy cows. This achievement in sophisticated technology agricultural automation would assist to boost productivity by reducing human involvement.

	abstract = {Automatic respiration monitoring of dairy cows in modern farming not only helps to reduce manual labor but also increases the automation of health assessment. It is common for cows to congregate on farms, which poses a challenge for manual observation of cow status because they physically occlude each other. In this study, we propose a method that can monitor the respiratory behavior of multiple cows. Initially, 4,000 manually labeled images were used to fine-tune the YOLACT (You Only Look At CoefficienTs) model for recognition and segmentation of multiple cows. Respiratory behavior in the resting state could better reflect their health status. Then, the specific resting states (lying resting, standing resting) of different cows were identified by fusing the convolutional neural network and bidirectional long and short-term memory algorithms. Finally, the corresponding detection algorithms (lying and standing resting) were used for respiratory behavior monitoring. The test results of 60 videos containing different interference factors indicated that the accuracy of respiratory behavior monitoring of multiple cows in 54 videos was >90.00%, and that of 4 videos was 100.00%. The average accuracy of the proposed method was 93.56%, and the mean absolute error and root mean square error were 3.42 and 3.74, respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the method was analyzed for simultaneous monitoring of respiratory behavior of multiple cows under movement, occlusion disturbance, and behavioral changes. It was feasible to monitor the respiratory behavior of multiple cows based on the proposed algorithm. This study could provide an a priori technical basis for respiratory behavior monitoring and automatic diagnosis of respiratory-related diseases of multiple dairy cows based on biomedical engineering technology. In addition, it may stimulate researchers to develop robots with health-sensing functions that are oriented toward precision livestock farming. © 2023 American Dairy Science Association},

The pasture was divided into nine plots, with two and three plots assigned as the ‘herding area’ in August and September, respectively. When the cows were grazing in the herding area, the operator maneuvered the drone to move the animals out of the area. The drone first approached at an altitude of 10 m; if the cows did not move away, the altitude was gradually lowered to 3 m. The behavioral responses to the drone, success or failure of herding (whether the cows left the area or not), and drone altitude were classified based on videos recorded during herding. The behavior and location of the cows in the pasture were observed during this period. The utilization rates of the plots (percentage of grazing time) were calculated to evaluate the effects of herding and the number of herding days. The cows responded in 59% and 46% of the cases on days 1 and 2, respectively. Startle behavior was recorded in 23% of the responses on day 1. Herding was successful in 51–75% of the cases on days 1–3. However, these percentages decreased thereafter. The utilization rate of the herding area on day 1 was approximately half that on days without herding. It increased from day 2, and almost no effect on grazing distribution was observed on or after day 3. These findings suggest that the cows exhibited little fear of drones after 1-day herding, and responses to the drones decreased as the animals subsequently became habituated to frequently repeated stimuli. Even after a 24-day interval, responsiveness to drone herding barely recovered and then declined. Therefore, drone herding was hardly effective in manipulating grazing distribution. Further investigation of stimulation that persistently elicits desirable responses is needed for future applications in technologies for the autonomous control of animal movement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

This study aims to consolidate the latest interdisciplinary research in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of assessment of water quality parameters and its prediction. This research paper specifically explores the intricate relationship between climate change and water quality parameters at Sandia station, situated within the Narmada basin in Central India. As global climatic patterns continue to shift, the repercussions on water resources have gained prominence. In this work, electrical conductivity is predicted using the KERAS data processing environment on TensorFlow. The root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Nash– Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), etc. are calculated between observed and predicted values to assess the model performance. A total of ten models are developed depending upon the input geometry from past monthly timelines. The results indicate that model 8, with ten inputs, performs the best based on the R2 value of 0.889. These results indicate that AI can be very helpful in analyzing the possible threats in the future for drinking water, livestock feeding, irrigation, and so on. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Artificial insemination with frozen semen is of great value for livestock breeding and improvement. However, the procedure of cryopreservation leads to varying degree of oxidative and cryodamage to sperms deteriorating its quality, capacitation status and fertility. Hence, a variety of protocols, cryoprotectants and additives have been tried to protect sperms from such damages. This study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and cryocapacitation inhibitory potential of Mifepristone, Sericin and Taurine in routine extender on cryopreserved bull semen including in vivo fertility. Methods: Semen ejaculates of 3 Gir and 3 Murrah bulls with >75% initial motility were split-diluted @ 100 million spermatozoa ml-1 using TFYG extender without and with Mifepristone (10 µg/ml), Sericin (5 mg/ml) and Taurine (4 mg/ml) and frozen in LN2 using a programmable biofreezer. The freshly diluted as well as frozen-thawed samples were assessed for sperm motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, CTC (chlortetracycline) fluorescence assay and seminal plasma oxidative markers. The straws frozen as above were used to inseminate 100-375 cows and/or buffaloes with each treatment involving well trained field AI technicians. Conception rates were determined based on confirmation of pregnancy per-rectum 45-60 days after first AI in non-return cases. Result: The mean percentages, on dilution and at post-thaw stage in particular, of motile, live, HOS reactive and non-capacitated sperm were significantly (p<0.01) higher with reduced lipid peroxidation (MDA, SOD and GPx) whereas capacitated and acrosome reacted sperm were lower in Mifepristone supplemented extender than in control extender and the values for Sericin and Taurine fortified extender were intermediary in both the species. The first AI conception rates obtained for Gir and Murrah bull semen cryopreserved in control extender and extender supplemented with Mifepristone, Sericin and Taurine were 44.48, 51.11, 47.22 and 48.72% in cattle and 44.44, 55.40, 51.57 and 52.05% in buffaloes, respectively, suggesting that all additives used and Mefipristone in particular can be advantageously incorporated in the semen extender for cryopreservation of both cattle and buffalo semen. © 2023 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {Each year, approximately 2.1 million sheep are released to graze freely in vast, forest-covered, and mountainous areas throughout Norway. At the end of the grazing season, farmers must find and round up their sheep. This can be a time consuming and challenging process because of the large area and cluttered nature of the sheep grazing environment. Existing technologies that help farmers find their sheep, such as bells, radio bells, electronic ear tags and UAVs, are limited by the cost, signal coverage, and low degree of automation, which cannot efficiently and automatically locate sheep in the wild. This study proposes an automatic sheep detection algorithm using UAV images. A model architecture using the ResNet and ResNeXt as the backbone networks is designed to address the automatic sheep detection task from UAV RGB and infrared images. Our study evaluates how well this model meets performance and processing speed requirements of a real-world application. We also compare models using fused RGB and infrared data to models using either RGB or infrared as input, and further explore the model complexity and generalization ability. Results show that fusion of RGB and infrared data yields better average precision results than using single RGB or infrared dataset in the model. The set of optimal solutions achieve average precision scores in the range of 69.6% to 96.3% with inference times ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 seconds per image. The most accurate network achieves a grid precision of 97.9% and a recall of 90.1%, at a confidence threshold of 0.5. This corresponds to the detection of 97.5% of the sheep in the validation dataset. These satisfactory results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed automatic sheep detection method using multi-channel UAV images for improving sheep roundup. © 2023 South China University of Technology.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of trends in the development of industrial technologies in the field of agriculture showed that manufacturers of technological equipment used on farms turn to robotics to exclude human labor when performing labor-intensive cyclical operations that are accompanied by a high degree of tension. To perform operations for the preparation and distribution of feed on a farm, maintenance of the feed table, as well as for manure harvesting, it is necessary to use a wheeled robotic platform with an automatic positioning system. AIMS: Development and testing of the software and hardware system of the Feed Pusher robot for the autonomous execution of operations for the maintenance of the feed table at livestock facilities. METHODS: Wheeled robot motion simulation, as well as a mathematical description of the kinematic and dynamic properties of the wheeled robot motion was carried out using the MATLAB software and the Simscape library and the Simulink application. The Figma graphic design software was used to develop layouts of mobile software interfaces for the wheeled robot remote control. RESULTS: During the wheeled robot motion simulation, direct and inverse kinematics problems were solved, consisting in finding the ω1, ω 2 vectors with the input parameters x0, y0, ϕ0, x, y, ϕ, as well as the final angle of the path (relative to the horizontal). Layouts of the robot remote control software interfaces have been developed, as well as the frontend and backend development of the program adapted to the use at a smartphone has been carried out. The testing of the wheeled robot was carried out at a livestock facility, during the maintenance of the feed table and the simultaneous execution of operations to push the feed to the fence and dosing of feed additives. CONCLUSIONS: The practical value of the research lies in the possibility of using the results of the wheeled robot motion simulation to adjust the operation of the automatic positioning system. At the same time, the farmer using the proposed Feed Pusher robot will ensure an increase in the technological efficiency of cattle keeping, in particular dairy cattle, with an increase in milk yields up to 1 liter per day per head, which was determined during the tests on the farm. © Eco-Vector, 2023.},

However, traditional observation consumes a significant amount of time and labor. This study aims to develop an autonomous AI-based robot monitoring system to detect molt. In this study, we used an optimized Yolov5s algorithm and DeepLabCut tool to analyze and detect all six molting phases such as S1 (normal), S2 (stress), S3–S5 (molt), and S6 (exoskeleton). We constructed the proposed optimized Yolov5s algorithm to analyze the frequency of posture change between S1 (normal) and S2 (stress). During this stage, if the lobster stays stressed for 80% of the past 6 h, the system will assign the keypoint from the DeepLabCut tool to the lobster hip. The process primarily concentrates on the S3–S5 stage to identify the variation in the hatching spot. At the end of this process, the system will re-import the optimized Yolov5s to detect the presence of an independent shell, S6, inside the tank. The optimized Yolov5s embedded a Convolutional Block Attention Module into the backbone network to improve the feature extraction capability of the model, which has been evaluated by evaluation metrics, comparison studies, and IoU comparisons between Yolo’s to understand the network’s performance. Additionally, we conducted experiments to measure the accuracy of the DeepLabCut Tool’s detections. © 2023 by the authors.},

Extension professionals are at the heart of disseminating agricultural advisory agricultural services in India. The discourse on the IoT is entering the space of extension advisory services (EASs) and social sciences. Thus, the present paper seeks to review the application of IoT in Indian agriculture, its challenges and its effect on EASs. The conceptual framework is drawn from disruptive and surveillance capitalist theories. Design/methodology/approach: Online literature review was conducted on electronic e-book Ebsco, Google scholar, PubMed, Jane, j gate, research4life, springer journal and Mendeley databases for full-text repositories, textbook, thesis, web articles, newspaper articles, reports, blogs for the year 1990 to May 2021 using keywords “IoT application in agriculture,” “emerging technologies in agriculture,” “challenges in IoT application,” “extension advisory services sources of information,” “big data and extension advisory, “IoT and extension advisory in India.” Only publications in the English language were included. Findings: IoT aids progressive farmers and small farmers alike. Drones, robotics, precision irrigation, livestock tracking and crop disease surveillance are examples of IoT applications in agriculture. Only large corporations and governments access IoT, and for them, big data storage is an issue. Privacy and security concerns demand upgrades in IoT systems. Solutions to the convergence of IoT with the cloud will leverage agricultural EASs, resulting in fast computing, precise and proactive up-to-date problem solving. Hence, the need for communication between firms and clients has ceased. Thus, the jobs of extension agents are replaced. Research limitations/implications: The competence of future human extension agents lies in reskilling as a “knowledge broker” of relationships and expertise, as s/he cannot have all multidisciplinary knowledge. Originality/value: Although IoT applications in agriculture are available from a technological standpoint, there remains an awareness gap regarding the impact of IoT applications in agricultural EASs. This study will aid in a better comprehension of IoT applications from current and prospective EASs. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Systems biology integrates the data of all the omics studies and provides the avenues to understand the biology of an organism at higher levels like at tissue, organ or organism level. In the last decade, studies of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics have been carried out. Only a limited amount of this big data has been analyzed, which is mainly focused on the genotype (single nucleotide polymorphism) level like minor allele frequency, copy number variation and structural variants. The analysis in transcriptomics is limited to differentially expressed genes and their ontology. Proteomics is focused on virulent factors, proteins involved in the disease progression and immunomodulation. However, in the case of livestock animals, there is a need to develop pipelines for the analysis of the omics data. With the integration of omics data into systems biology studies, there is a need to develop algorithms to carry out gene interaction and protein interaction studies and to build interaction networks. The pathway analysis of a system requires the well-defined interacting hub and edges of the protein system of an organism. Developing AI-ML models for drug discovery is required to target the pathogens of livestock animals. In the present era, the research is moving towards single-cell sequencing of the cells and tissues to explore the genetic heterogeneity in the micro-environment of the tissue and spatial biology of the tissue. This chapter will introduce the reader to different aspects of omics technology and its role in systems biology for better livestock management. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.

	abstract = {In response to the complex animal husbandry environment, wide livestock range, and labor shortage in Inner Mongolia grasslands, this study designed an intelligent control system for robotic vehicles used in natural grazing grassland environments. The control system consists of software and hardware components and motion control algorithms. Based on the application characteristics of different mechanisms of the robotic vehicle, the motion control of the robotic vehicle is decomposed into longitudinal speed control and lateral steering control. The longitudinal speed control adopts the traditional Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) control method. Since the hardware composition and internal angle calculation method of the steering system are complex and prone to deviations caused by external terrain, a lateral adaptive fuzzy PID controller was constructed with lateral deviation and deviation change rate as input variables and parameters (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.) as outputs. The field test results show that when the longitudinal speed was set to 0.5 m/s, the adjustment time was 1.95 s, and the steady-state error was about 0. When the longitudinal speed was the same, the lateral adaptive fuzzy PID controller reduced the rise time by 0.77 s compared to traditional control methods, reduced overshoot and steady-state error by 2%, and quickly recovered to a steady state after being disturbed. The following test results show that the designed intelligent control system can achieve real-time tracking of targets and that the motion controllers can effectively control speed and steering angle. Therefore, the intelligent control system designed in this paper can effectively achieve stable and real-time control of the robotic vehicle. © 2023 by the authors.},

The application of AI and ML in livestock farming has led to an improved understanding of animal behavior and discomfort, the prevention and management of diseases, and the efficiency of the farmer's economic choices. Digital twin technology is a particularly promising field that builds on AI and is already being utilized to increase efficiency and decrease costs in cattle livestock agriculture. A Digital Twin (DT) is a constant-update numerical copy of smart livestock environments. The proposed research is IoT, and Digital Twins in Livestock Farming (DTLF) might expand extensive Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), technology and tools use, and farm animal health and well-being. Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), AI, and even ML are only some current technologies that may be used for automated tracking of individual animal whereabouts. There is promise in using these methods and innovations to monitor and evaluate animal welfare, but these techniques are difficult. Just like other revolutionary innovations, the utilization of the DT mechanism will improve disease analysis prediction for individual farms by a factor of 92%. The responsiveness of DTLF will be a 92% response rate in analyzing the Heartbeat, a 94% effectiveness rate in analyzing the Temperature Range, and a 94% overall effectiveness in evaluating the Humidity Range. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Optimization of biomethane yield from the anaerobic co-digestion process has taken a new dimension from the application of common statistical techniques to the use of intelligence models in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. In this study, the performance of fuzzy c-means (FCM)-clustered adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was compared with the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in investigating the impact of critical process parameters, namely temperature, retention time, and mixing ratio on the methane yield of anaerobic co-digestion of duck waste and Xyris capensis. Relevant statistical metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute deviation (MAD) was used to evaluate the performance of the FCM-ANFIS model developed. The developed RSM and FCM-ANFIS models were compared based on the predicted yields and optimum conditions. It was observed from the results that the process parameters have a significant influence on the methane yield of anaerobic co-digestion of duck waste and Xyris capensis. The cumulative yield of 478.42, 478.43, and 436.20 mL CH4/g VSadded was observed for experimental, RSM, and ANFIS-FCM5clusters models, respectively. The optimum daily methane yield was observed when the mixing ratio was 75% duck waste and 25% Xyris capensis for the experimental and ANFIS-FCM5 clusters model. In contrast, the RSM model observed it at 100% duck waste. The RMSE, MAD, MAE, and MAPE values of the optimal neuro-fuzzy model (ANFIS-FCM5clusters) test indicated that the neuro-fuzzy model developed performs better than the RSM model with minimal error and higher accuracy. RSM and ANFIS models were noticed to be practical models for methane yield optimization and prediction from anaerobic co-digestion of livestock waste and lignocellulose feedstocks in a multiple-input variable without undertaking an experiment within a short time and error. These models can be used to optimize the anaerobic digestion process of lignocellulose materials and livestock waste at the industrial scale. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Automatic scoring by using sensor technology and artificial intelligence (AI) may bring a solution. Based on review papers an overview was made of ABMs recorded at the slaughterhouse for poultry, pigs and cattle and applications of sensor technology to measure the identified ABMs. Also, relevant legislation and work instructions of the Dutch Regulatory Authority (RA) were scanned on applied ABMs. Applications of sensor technology in a research setting, on farm or at the slaughterhouse were reported for 10 of the 37 ABMs identified for poultry, 4 of 32 for cattle and 13 of 41 for pigs. Several applications are related to aspects of meat inspection. However, by European law meat inspection must be performed by an official veterinarian, although there are exceptions for the post mortem inspection of poultry. The examples in this study show that there are opportunities for using sensor technology by the RA to support the inspection and to give more insight into animal welfare risks.

	abstract = {In the context of the "antibiotic ban" era, the feed conversion of medicinal and edible traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) resources is a research hotspot in the field of antibiotic alternatives development. How to develop feed products that are beneficial to agriculture and livestock while ensuring nutrient balance and precision using medicinal and edible TCM resources as raw materials has become a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has unique advantages in feed production and improving the efficiency of intelligent breeding. If AI technology is applied to the feed development of medicinal and edible TCM resources, it is possible to realize feeding and antibiotic-replacement value while ensuring precise nutrition. In order to better apply AI technology in the field of feed development of medicinal and edible TCM resources, this article used CiteSpace software to carry out literature visualization analysis and found that AI technology had a good application in the field of feed formulation optimization in recent years. However, there is still a gap in the research on the intelligent utilization of medicinal and edible TCM resources. Nonetheless, it is feasible for AI technology to be applied to the feed conversion of medicinal and edible TCM resources. Therefore, this article proposed for the first time an intelligent formulation system framework for feed materials derived from medicinal and edible TCM resources to provide new ideas for research in the field of feed development of medicinal and edible TCM resources and the research on the development of antibiotic alternatives. At the same time, it can pave the way for a new green industry chain for contemporary animal husbandry and the TCM industry. © 2024 Zhongguo Zhongyi Yanjiuyuan. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Compliance issues riddle the agricultural sector despite being an essential industry for the human race. Many factors contribute to compliance issues; however, meat cut label verification is one of the most critical concerns due to its erroneous nature. In addition, meat cut identification is complex for the human eye. Thus, access to a skilled labor force is challenging. Nevertheless, meat compliance is essential since it has export compliance ramifications. These factors, along with others, are pushing for a digital alternative. An alternative that can augment human decision-making in verifying meat cut box labels. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a digital alternative that can boost quality assurance tasks. One of AI's potential quality assurance solutions is a Meat Box Labeling Verification (BLV) solution that can verify the boxed meat type against the label to ensure no mismatch. Two major components make up the BLV solution: Meat Identification and Label Analysis. This work aims to solve the former component by exploring different meat-type identification techniques. It explores them by building, evaluating, and testing different computer vision solutions. Hence, the novel contribution of this work is three folds. We first build, test, and design computer vision solutions that detect meat boxes and pieces accurately. These solutions include deep learning methods in classification and object detection techniques. Following that, we evaluate these models and derive key insights. Such insights are valuable for prototyping such solutions in production environments. For example, classification models achieve a 99% testing accuracy in identifying box types. In contrast, object detection achieved 89% mAP@.5:.95 in identified individual meat cuts. Finally, we prototype an object detection model in a natural meat processing environment—the demonstration showed comparable object detection precision at 85% mAP@.5:.95. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Heat stress has vital importance in livestock farming due to the physiological changes on the animals so that meat and milk production is significantly degraded. Recently, the hereditary and mental effects of environmental conditions have also been discussed for future generations. Therefore, high-level automation solutions are required to keep the environmental conditions in the barns as optimal as possible. In this paper, a hangar-type scaled-down barn was experimentally designed for modelling and control of the environmental conditions. First, the temperature-humidity index (THI) which is a measure of the heat stress, was stabilized to its critical value in two regions of the barn by using proportional-integrative-derivative (PID) controller. The ventilation fans were controlled at variable speeds so that energy efficiency was also provided when compared to the on-off control. Second, we proposed the state-space modelling of the coupled temperature and humidity dynamics for the interior space of the barn so that the obtained model can be utilized for mathematical analysis and accurate control. Specifically, state monitoring and prediction, optimal control, and observer-based sensor-less control are to be applied based on its state-space model. The parameters of the state-space model were here estimated with an Extended-Kalman Filter (EKF). Performances are calculated in terms of mean square error (MSE), and the performance values were found to be less than 5% for stabilization and less than 2% for modelling, respectively. The proposed scaled-down barn model is a low-cost design that can be used as an example for those who work in this field to conduct experimental studies before making large investments. Barn design can also be modified for modelling, analysis, and control of new heat stress measures in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The rapid evolution of 3D technology in recent years has brought about significant change in the field of agriculture, including precision livestock management. From 3D geometry information, the weight and characteristics of body parts of Korean cattle can be analyzed to improve cow growth. In this paper, a system of cameras is built to synchronously capture 3D data and then reconstruct a 3D mesh representation. In general, to reconstruct non-rigid objects, a system of cameras is synchronized and calibrated, and then the data of each camera are transformed to global coordinates. However, when reconstructing cattle in a real environment, difficulties including fences and the vibration of cameras can lead to the failure of the process of reconstruction. A new scheme is proposed that automatically removes environmental fences and noise. An optimization method is proposed that interweaves camera pose updates, and the distances between the camera pose and the initial camera position are added as part of the objective function. The difference between the camera’s point clouds to the mesh output is reduced from 7.5 mm to 5.5 mm. The experimental results showed that our scheme can automatically generate a high-quality mesh in a real environment. This scheme provides data that can be used for other research on Korean cattle. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Yaks (Bos grunniens) are the most important domestic animals for people living at high altitudes. In order to implement precise livestock management for yaks, it is of significant importance to automatically identify, keep track of, and monitor yaks. Traditional animal identification methods such as ear tags, tattoos, and RFID based methods suffer from problems like animal infection, high maintenance cost, inefficiency or sensor failure. Existing biometric-based identification methods for livestock such as muzzle prints, iris patterns, and retinal vascular patterns mostly require that animals are under control, either technically or physically, and are thus costly to deploy especially for yaks which are loosely raised on the grassland pastures and migrate with the seasons. In this paper, we propose a novel method for identifying individual yaks in in-the-wild images captured under unconstrained conditions. We utilize the part-based convolutional network (PCN) to obtain discriminative part-level feature representations. To further enhance the feature discriminativeness and alleviate the impact of small amount of yak image data, we implement self-supervised learning strategy by proposing random erasure and region-visibility prediction (RERP) as an auxiliary learning task. Experiments performed on the YakReID-103 dataset demonstrate that (i) when left and right side views of yaks are treated separately, the Rank-1 accuracy and mAP achieved by the proposed method with SEResNet50 backbone are up to 97.57% and 76.30%, which significantly advance the state-of-the-art, and (ii) when generalizing to different views, the proposed method with ViT backbone again obtains the best results compared with the counterpart methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Agricultural and pastoral landscapes can provide important habitat for wildlife conservation, but sharing these landscapes with wildlife can create conflict that is costly and requires managing. Livestock predation is a good example of the challenges involving coexistence with wildlife across shared landscapes. Integrating new technology into agricultural practices could help minimize human-wildlife conflict. In this study, we used concepts from the fields of robotics (i.e., automated movement and adaptiveness) and agricultural practices (i.e., managing livestock risk to predation) to explore how integration of these concepts could aid the development of more effective predator deterrents. Methods: We used a colony of captive coyotes as a model system, and simulated predation events with meat baits inside and outside of protected zones. Inside the protected zones we used a remote-controlled vehicle with a state-of-the art, commercially available predator deterrent (i.e., Foxlight) mounted on the top and used this to test three treatments: (1) light only (i.e., without movement or adaptiveness), (2) predetermined movement (i.e., with movement and without adaptiveness), and (3) adaptive movement (i.e., with both movement and adaptiveness). We measured the time it took for coyotes to eat the baits and analyzed the data with a time-to-event survival strategy. Results: Survival of baits was consistently higher inside the protected zone, and the three movement treatments incrementally increased survival time over baseline except for the light only treatment in the nonprotected zone. Incorporating predetermined movement essentially doubled the efficacy of the light only treatment both inside and outside the protected zone. Incorporating adaptive movement exponentially increased survival time both inside and outside the protected zone. Our findings provide compelling evidence that incorporating existing robotics capabilities (predetermined and adaptive movement) could greatly enhance protection of agricultural resources and aid in the development of nonlethal tools for managing wildlife. Our findings also demonstrate the importance of marrying agricultural practices (e.g., spatial management of livestock at night) with new technology to improve the efficacy of wildlife deterrents. © 2023 PeerJ Inc..

	abstract = {[Significance] Autonomous and intelligent agricultural machinery, characterized by green intelligence, energy efficiency, and reduced emissions, as well as high intelligence and man-machine collaboration, will serve as the driving force behind global agricultural technology advancements and the transformation of production methods in the context of smart agriculture development. Agricultural robots, which utilize intelligent control and information technology, have the unique advantage of replacing manual labor. They occupy the strategic commanding heights and competitive focus of global agricultural equipment and are also one of the key development directions for accelerating the construction of China's agricultural power. World agricultural powers and China have incorporated the research, development, manufacturing, and promotion of agricultural robots into their national strategies, respectively strengthening the agricultural robot policy and planning layout based on their own agricultural development characteristics, thus driving the agricultural robot industry into a stable growth period. [Progress] This paper firstly delves into the concept and defining features of agricultural robots, alongside an exploration of the global agricultural robot development policy and strategic planning blueprint. Furthermore, sheds light on the growth and development of the global agricultural robotics industry; Then proceeds to analyze the industrial backdrop, cutting-edge advancements, developmental challenges, and crucial technology aspects of three representative agricultural robots, including farmland robots, orchard picking robots, and indoor vegetable production robots. Finally, summarizes the disparity between Chinese agricultural robots and their foreign counterparts in terms of advanced technologies. (1) An agricultural robot is a multi-degree-of-freedom autonomous operating equipment that possesses accurate perception, autonomous decision-making, intelligent control, and automatic execution capabilities specifically designed for agricultural environments. When combined with artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things, agricultural robots form an agricultural robot application system. This system has relatively mature applications in key processes such as field planting, fertilization, pest control, yield estimation, inspection, harvesting, grafting, pruning, inspection, harvesting, transportation, and livestock and poultry breeding feeding, inspection, disinfection, and milking. Globally, agricultural robots, represented by plant protection robots, have entered the industrial application phase and are gradually realizing commercialization with vast market potential. (2) Compared to traditional agricultural machinery and equipment, agricultural robots possess advantages in performing hazardous tasks, executing batch repetitive work, managing complex field operations, and livestock breeding. In contrast to industrial robots, agricultural robots face technical challenges in three aspects. Firstly, the complexity and unstructured nature of the operating environment. Secondly, the flexibility, mobility, and commoditization of the operation object. Thirdly, the high level of technology and investment required. (3) Given the increasing demand for unmanned and less manned operations in farmland production, China's agricultural robot research, development, and application have started late and progressed slowly. The existing agricultural operation equipment still has a significant gap from achieving precision operation, digital perception, intelligent management, and intelligent decision-making. The comprehensive performance of domestic products lags behind foreign advanced counterparts, indicating that there is still a long way to go for industrial development and application. Firstly, the current agricultural robots predominantly utilize single actuators and operate as single machines, with the development of multi-arm cooperative robots just emerging. Most of these robots primarily engage in rigid operations, exhibiting limited flexibility, adaptability, and functionality. Secondly, the perception of multi-source environments in agricultural settings, as well as the autonomous operation of agricultural robot equipment, relies heavily on human input. Thirdly, the progress of new teaching methods and technologies for human-computer natural interaction is rather slow. Lastly, the development of operational infrastructure is insufficient, resulting in a relatively low degree of "mechanization". [Conclusions and Prospects] The paper anticipates the opportunities that arise from the rapid growth of the agricultural robotics industry in response to the escalating global shortage of agricultural labor. It outlines the emerging trends in agricultural robot technology, including autonomous navigation, self-learning, real-time monitoring, and operation control. In the future, the path planning and navigation information perception of agricultural robot autonomy are expected to become more refined. Furthermore, improvements in autonomous learning and cross-scenario operation performance will be achieved. The development of real-time operation monitoring of agricultural robots through digital twinning will also progress. Additionally, cloud-based management and control of agricultural robots for comprehensive operations will experience significant growth. Steady advancements will be made in the innovation and integration of agricultural machinery and techniques. copyright©2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The objective of this observational study was to evaluate the association between increased physical activity at first artificial insemination (AI) and subsequent pregnancy per AI (P/AI) in lactating Holstein cows following spontaneous estrus or a timed AI (TAI) protocol. We also wanted to identify factors associated with the intensity of activity increase (PA) captured by automated activity monitors (AAM) and fertility. Two experiments were conducted, in which cows either were inseminated based on the alert of the AAM system (AAM cows) or received TAI following a 7-d Ovsynch protocol (TAI cows) if not inseminated within a farm-specific period after calving. Experiment 1 included 2,698 AI services from AAM cows and 1,042 AI services from TAI cows equipped with the Smarttag Neck (Nedap Livestock Management) from a dairy farm in Slovakia (farm 1). In the second experiment, 6,517 AI services from AAM cows and 1,226 AI services from TAI cows fitted with Heatime (Heatime Pro; SCR Engineers Ltd.) from 8 dairy farms in Germany (farms 2–9) were included. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed on a weekly basis by transrectal ultrasound (farms 1, 3, 7, 8) or by transrectal palpation (farms 2, 4–6, 9). Estrous intensity was represented by the peak value of the change in activity. In experiment 1, PA was categorized into low (x-factor 0–20) and high (x-factor 21–100) PA, and in experiment 2 into low (activity change = 35–89) and high (activity change = 90–100) PA. In TAI cows from both experiments, PA was additionally categorized into cows with no AAM alert. Data were analyzed separately for AAM and TAI cows using multinomial logistic regression models for PA in TAI cows and logistic regression models for PA in AAM cows and P/AI in both groups. In experiment 1, P/AI of AAM cows was greater for AI services performed with conventional frozen semen (57.6%) compared with sexed semen (47.2%), whereas type of semen only tended to be associated with P/AI in TAI cows (54.4% conventional frozen semen vs. 48.9% sexed semen). In experiment 2, P/AI was greater for fresh semen (AAM cows: 44.4% vs. TAI cows: 44.2%) compared with conventional frozen semen (AAM cows: 37.6% vs. TAI cows: 34.6%). In both experiments, pregnancy outcomes were associated with PA. In experiment 1, AAM cows with high PA (55.1%) had greater P/AI than cows with low PA (49.8%). Within TAI cows, cows with no alert (38.8%) had reduced P/AI compared with cows with low (54.2%) or high PA (61.8%). In experiment 2, AAM cows with high PA (45.8%) had greater P/AI compared with cows with low PA (36.4%). Timed AI cows with no alert (27.4%) had decreased P/AI compared with cows with low (41.1%) or high (50.8%) PA. The greatest risk factors for high PA were parity (experiment 1) and season of AI (except for TAI cows from experiment 1). We conclude that high PA at the time of AI is associated with greater odds of pregnancy for both AAM and TAI cows. In both experiments, about 2 thirds of AAM cows (experiment 1: 69.9% and experiment 2: 70.7%) reached high PA, whereas only approximately one-third or less of TAI cows (experiment 1: 37.3% and experiment 2: 23.6%) showed high PA. Although we observed similar results using 2 different AAM systems for the most part, risk factors for high PA might differ between farms and insemination type (i.e., AAM vs. TAI). © 2023 American Dairy Science Association},

The rabbit's growth cycle is short compared to pork that's what makes the rabbit as the perfect alternative to pork. The automation of farming is helpful in changing the patterns and processes in both industry and agriculture towards higher efficiency. The automated feeding system is a device that provides a simple and effective method for feeding the rabbits without ever visiting each cage. It also helps the person in charge of a rabbit poultry farm to feed the rabbits and notifying the owner when the feed in the rabbit feeder needs to be refilled. This system can help improve the proper feeding time for rabbit to achieve higher chance of improving their growth. The automated feeding system consists of two main parts which are the control system and the notification system. The control system consists of set of Arduino Uno Mega, Arduino Nano, and servo motor. The notification system consists of SIM800L Module and Real time clock module.

	abstract = {At present, it is generally recognized that the livestock industry has a negative impact on the environment, including, first of all, the soil, as well as water and air. This impact increases with the development of industrial production of livestock and poultry products. Environmental pollution risks from livestock production are associated with the disposal of manure and litter, as well as greenhouse gas emissions throughout the production cycle. One of the main objectives of modern livestock production is to reduce emissions. Cattle breeding is one of the most important branches of agriculture, which serves as the basis of food security of the country. Therefore, the aim of the article is to improve production processes in livestock farming using digital technologies in order to reduce harmful effects. In this regard, we propose a model of digital management of livestock production, which is a set of certain digital systems based on geoinformation technologies. Digital systems cover all technological stages of breeding, care and fattening, and production. These systems include: reproduction, animal identification, microclimate, feeding, veterinary, waste, and product control.

Smart agriculture opens a door of opportunities in disease detection, classification, and crop management. In this work, authors analyze how real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI) can classify plant disease from leaf images. Leaf images can be collected through the Internet of Things (IoT)-based camera by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and stored in a remote database from where further learning can be done by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The novelty of this research is an attempt to hybridize the concept of IoT and ML in precision farming. As we all know, in the global economy, agriculture plays a vital role in relation to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). With the expansion of the human population, we need intensive farming for better livestock management. Considering the real-time scenario, AI-enabled applications can provide a rich recommendation to our farmers.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important tool for optimising breeding processes in several areas of animal production. In this thesis, we have presented examples from the literature, mainly for the identification and counting of cattle. The individual identification of animals, the monitoring of their behaviour and the control of their movements support a number of conclusions from both animal welfare and veterinary point of view. Automation of the processing of captured images has also become essential. This process is supported by Artificial Intelligence. Deep learning and neural networks are excellent tools for segmenting images and processing their content based on different features. Convolutional neural networks are specifically powerful for such tasks and we have seen that further developments of these networks (e.g. Faster R-CNN) allow even more efficient image analysis procedures. Processing animal images can be a major step forward for automatic analysis and identification of livestock. It also allows early intervention in the event of disease. In the context of individual identification, it is important to underline that, when complemented with other measurement options, e.g. sensor measurements, it offers even more complex applications that have not been available so far. © 2023, Herman Otto Intezet.

	abstract = {In recent scenario, livestock industries in many countries require technologies that can influence the productivity rate in meat or dairy productions, where humans play major role. On reviewing many works, there is always a demand for a monitoring model using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and security in data sharing has been a major concern. With that consideration, a novel IoT-based Secure Livestock Monitoring System (SLMS) is proposed using Internet of Things (IoT) and intelligent sensors. The proposed model includes three modules, accurate environmental factor modelling, and an animal collar, embedded with GPS for location tracking, temperature sensor, heart rate sensor, and security enforcement module. Moreover, to collect data from required modules and keep a separate database for additional analysis, a unique IoT-based front end has been designed. The offered Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs) are capable of making intelligent determinations in the event of any environmental factor instability. Also, the animal collar is made to measure the animal’s temperature, heart rate, and location with accuracy. Security enforcement is also carried out to preserve the model’s data integrity. It used a plug-and-play approach to make implementation simple. Also, automation eliminates the need for human involvement, which lowers labor expenses for farms with a large number of animals. The proposed system also increases the production of dairy and meat products by improving animal health via the regularisation of the environment. The current study represents a comprehensive comparative analysis of the proposed implementation with the existing systems that validate the novelty of this work. © 2023, Scibulcom Ltd.

	abstract = {The swine industry constitutes a significant segment within livestock farming. However, conventional methods employed for monitoring pig health and welfare are laborious and time-intensive. Relying on these traditional monitoring techniques becomes increasingly taxing for both pigs and farmers, particularly in the face of the expanding scale of hog farming. This stress, in turn, impacts pig welfare and overall economic productivity. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a fundamental component in the realm of intelligent pig farming. Advanced pig farming systems leverage AI integration to continuously monitor biometric data encompassing pig vocalizations and behavior. This data, acquired through sensors such as cameras and RF ID devices, is transformed into pivotal indicators of pig health and welfare. Analyzing these essential variables enables the early identification of health issues affecting pigs, facilitating prompt interventions and treatments that significantly enhance production efficiency and financial outcomes in pig farming. This paper presents a comprehensive overview, highlighting the challenges and opportunities within precision pig husbandry. The fusion of AI technologies with traditional farming practices presents novel prospects and hurdles, shaping the landscape of modern pig farming. Through this evaluation, the paper aims to underscore the transformative potential and the evolving landscape of precision-based pig farming. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As a result of human activities, the production of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere has increased in the past few hundred years, which has contributed to the phenomenon of climate change. As the emissions of methane, a significant greenhouse gas, have risen tremendously in recent years, especially from the agricultural sector, numerous studies have been undertaken to find efficient methods for reducing these emissions. A major focus of this chapter is on reducing the amount of methane emitted from livestock production, particularly animal waste, and offers biological alternatives that include the use of biofertilizers and biochar, the microbial conversion of methane, genetic modification, and biogas production. It is also suggested that precision agriculture (PA) policies and digital innovations, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and robotic systems, be implemented to carefully monitor the application of manure to farms. Furthermore, government economic plans, such as offering financial assistance to farmers to minimize greenhouse gas emissions, which can be beneficial in lowering methane emissions. Although several strategies have been recommended to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, there has been no discernible shift in atmospheric methane concentrations; this would suggest that regulations such as PA on farms are not being carried out effectively. Climate change and global warming will worsen over the next few decades if no urgent action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature.},

In order to secure safe cattle resources and increase productivity for the livestock industry, it is necessary to secure the self-activities of the cattle and predict the estrous state of target cattle as quickly as possible. For the prediction of the estrous state, it is necessary to continuously observe the cattle behavior by workers and quantify the behavior of the target cattle, but that is not easy for workers and needs a long period of continuous observation. We developed the intelligent monitoring system (IMS) with the ARM (Augmented Recognition Model) for the intelligent farm that can predict the estrus of target cattle and get activity data for individual cattle, and then the system was applied to a typical cattle farm for activity monitoring of the Korean cattle (Hanwoo). Therefore, we confirmed the target Hanwoo group with more than 400 activities among the Hanwoo groups using the ARM threshold. Thus, we verified the potential of the proposed system for tracking multiple similar objects. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Through the observation of individual animal behavior, precision technologies are growing in the context of livestock farming to enhance management techniques and the health and well-being of cattle [1]-[3]. Numerous priority areas can be addressed by consistently gathering data on cattle behavior. The study was conducted to predict the behavioral pattern of cattle using a self-developed prototype model. This study confirmed that the prototype model, i.e., i) a Bluetooth-based cattle node with a neck collar, ii) a low-cost networked software architecture, and iii) a processing algorithm, may enhance livestock management. The low-power Bluetooth protocols provide a dependable data transfer module between the gateway and the node linked to the cow. This low-cost device might be valuable for quick and real-time implementations. A comparison study was made between annotated data and AI-ML algorithms, which showed a significant outcome. So, in this work, an advanced node-based health monitoring module is presented to correctly predict the behavioral parameters of individual cattle, which may help to predict health status far in advance.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The paper describes the implementation of the control logic for the management of a medium-scale digester plant through a smart automation system. Such a digester was developed to produce biogas and biomethane subsequently to anaerobic digestion of agri-food wastes, with a particular interest in olive mill by-products. Temperature and pH are the main parameters that control prototype running and automatism. The plant is fed with two matrices having respectively acid (in the case of olive mill wastewater) and alkaline pH (i.e. livestock manure), thanks to which, substrate pH value is set. The temperature control is ensured by a couple of armoured heater elements, while cooling can occur thanks to a water main directly connected to the digestor. The control logic is implemented for maintaining the temperature and pH values within a certain range to guarantee the optimal process parameters. The smart automation system consists of three PLC units, which manage the sensors to acquire temperature and pH data for process control, and pressure and flow sensors to determine biogas production. A remote control interface was designed to allow manual or automatic control of the plant. The interface enables to navigate between four different windows: manual control, automatic control, parameter setting and trends, which shows the real-time measurements provided by the sensors. Furthermore, the interface allows for setting process parameters, controlling process progress and saving data history. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is an infectious disease caused by a Poxviridae family of viruses to the cattle, and it is a transboundary disease affecting the cattle industry worldwide. Asia has the highest number of LSD reports from the year 2019 till today, as per the LSD outbreak report data generated by the World Organization of Animal Health. In India, it started in 2022 and resulted in the death of over 97,000 cattle in three months between July and September 2022. LSD transmission is mainly due to blood-feeding insects. The other water feed troughs and contaminated environments are minor cases. According to Cattle India Foundation (CIF) analysis, more than 16.42 lakh cattle have been infected by LSD, and 75,000 have died since July 2022. Thus, the reduction of the livestock mortality rate of cattle is significant today either by analyzing skin diseases or through early detection mechanisms. The LSD research is evolving and attracts various Artificial Intelligence (AI) experts to analyze the problem through image processing, machine learning, and deep learning. This chapter compares the performance of deep and hybrid deep learning models for detecting LSD. The challenges and limitations of this study have been extended into future scope for enhancements in LSD detection. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2023. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As digitalization in the agricultural sector has intensified, the number of studies addressing adoption and use of digital technologies in crop production and livestock farming has also increased. However, digitalization trends in the context of small-scale farming have mainly been excluded from such studies. The focus of this paper is on investigating the sequential adoption of precision agriculture (PA) and other digital technologies, and the use of multiple technologies in a small-scale agricultural region in southern Germany. An online survey of farmers yielded a total of 2,390 observations, of which 1,820 operate in field farming, and 1,376 were livestock farmers. A heuristic approach was deployed to identify adoption patterns. Probable multiple uses of 30 digital farming technologies and decision-support applications, as well as potential trends of sequential technology adoption were analyzed for four sequential points of adoption (entry technology, currently used technologies, and planned short-term and mid-term investments). Results show that Bavarian farmers cannot be described as exceedingly digitalized but show potential adoption rates of 15–20% within the next five years for technologies such as barn robotics, section control, variable-rate applications, and maps from satellite data. Established use of entry technologies (e.g., automatic milking systems, digital field records, automatic steering systems) increased the probability of adoption of additional technologies. Among the most used technologies, the current focus is on user-friendly automation solutions that reduce farmers’ workload. Identifying current equipment and technology trends in small-scale agriculture is essential to strengthen policy efforts to promote digitalization. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As our understanding of ovarian function in cattle has improved, our ability to control it has also increased. The development of Fixed-Time Artificial Insemination (FTAI) protocols at the end of the 20th century has increased exponentially the number of animals inseminated over the last 20 years. The main reasons for this growth were the possibility of obtaining acceptable pregnancy rates without heat detection and, above all, the induction of cyclicity in suckled cows in postpartum anestrus and prepubertal heifers at the beginning of the breeding season. Most FTAI treatments in South America have been based on the use of progesterone (P4) releasing devices and estradiol to synchronize both follicular wave emergence and ovulation, with pregnancy rates ranging from 40 to 60%. These protocols are implemented on a regular basis, allowing producers access to high-quality genetics, and increasing the overall pregnancy rates during the breeding season. In addition, it provided the professionals involved in these programs with a new source of income and the diversification of their practices into activities other than their usual clinical work. Many of these practices are now apparently at risk from restrictions on the use of estradiol by the European Union (EU) and other countries. However, the development of alternative protocols based on GnRH, with P4 devices and eCG and other new products that are not in the market yet will allow us to adapt to the new times that are coming. Logically, the challenge has already been raised and we must learn to use alternative protocols to try to continue increasing the use of this technology in beef and dairy herds. The objective of the present review is to describe the main aspects of banning estradiol in livestock production, the negative impacts on reproductive efficiency, and to present some alternative FTAI protocols for dairy and beef cattle. © The Author(s).

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The concept of responsible innovation is gaining traction in the Smart Farming field to address emerging socio-ethical issues such as power asymmetries between farmers and technology development companies in farm data ownership, and animal welfare issues arising from the automation of livestock management. Responsible innovation involves the democratisation of science and decision making for societal control of innovations. The application of responsible innovation principles to the adoption phase of Smart Farming technologies is an under explored area in terms of defining what responsible adoption practices are for Smart Farming, and with what effect. OBJECTIVE: This empirical research aims to provide insights into what responsible adoption practices might involve, based on application of a responsible innovation approach to designing a cross-industry adoption strategy for a virtual fencing technology in Australia. This case study also examines what responsible adoption practices mean for enacting responsible innovation of Smart Farming technologies more broadly. METHODS: A participatory Technology Assessment (pTA) approach engaged a range of virtual fencing technology end-users (livestock producers) and stakeholders (agricultural advisers, natural resource managers, food retailers, a food processor, and state government department staff) (n = 80). The participants identified and considered the benefits and risks of implementing a specific virtual fencing product in various contexts. The engagement methods were 12 interactive workshops organized in peer/sector groups and one reflective and deliberative consultation process with 13 adoption specialists and practitioners to define an adoption pathway for virtual herding technology. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of the virtual herding technology product requires multiple levels of support to ensure that the technology is used responsibly and generates private, industry and public goods. This prospective knowledge, built from the considerations of end-users and stakeholders, was integrated into a virtual herding adoption strategy, and accounted for animal welfare concerns, the empowerment of producers to lead their own adoption support network and the desire for some form of regulatory governance. The responsible adoption practices were limited by the lack of institutional pathways to mobilise the strategy beyond the life of the research project. SIGNIFICANCE: The research indicates that there is value in further pursuing the notion of responsible adoption practices for Smart Farming technologies. These practices need to be designed for understanding the complexity of the adoption situation, testing the assumptions about what the ‘right’ adoption pathway should be, and inclusive participation in the ongoing governance of adoption pathways. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Sheep farming is a strategic sector of livestock husbandry, and its production has large market demand in many countries. The live weight of sheep provides important information about the health state and the time point for marketing. Manual weighing sheep is time-consuming for farmers even with the help of a ground scale. With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart sensors, non-contact sheep weighing methods have gradually been used to estimate weight. However, the performance of prior studies tends to degenerate with varying postures and light conditions in practical natural environments. In this study, we propose a sheep live weight estimation approach based on LiteHRNet (a Lightweight High-Resolution Network) using RGB-D images. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) guided the design of efficient network heads embracing visual explanation and applicability in practical natural environments. Experiments are conducted on our challenging dataset (of 726 sheep RGB-D images, weight range between 19.5 to 94 kg). Comparative experiment results reveal that the lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on RGB-D images can reach an acceptable weight estimation result, Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) is 14.605% (95% confidence interval: [13.821%, 15.390%], t test) with only 1.06M parameters. Our works can be viewed as preliminary work that confirms the ability to use lightweight CNNs for sheep weight estimation on RGB-D data. The results of this study are potential to develop an embedded device to automatically estimate sheep live weight and would contribute to the development of precision livestock farming. © 2023},

	abstract = {Poultry production utilized many available technologies in terms of farmindustry automation and sanitary control. However, there is a lack of robust techniques and affordable equipment for avian embryo detection and sexual segregation at the early stages. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the potential use of thermal microcameras for detecting embryos in quail eggs via thermal images during the first 168 h (7 days) of incubation. We propose a methodology to collect data during incubation period. Additionally, to support the visual analysis, YOLO deep learning object detection algorithms were applied to detect unfertilized eggs; the results showed its potential to distinguish fertilized eggs from unfertilized eggs during the incubation period after filtering radiometric images. We compared YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and SSD-MobileNet V2 trained models. The mAP@0.50 of the YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and SSD-MobileNet V2 was 98.62%, 99.5%, and 91.8%, respectively. We also compared three testing datasets for different intervals of rotation of eggs, as our hypothesis was that fewer turning periods could improve the visualization of fertilized eggs features, and applied three treatments: 1.5, 6, and 12 h. The results showed that turning eggs in different periods did not exhibit a linear relation, as the F1 Score for YOLOv4 of detection for the 12 h period was 0.569, that for the 6 h period was 0.404 and that for the 1.5 h period was 0.384. YOLOv5 F1 Scores for 12, 6, and 1.5 h was 1, 0.545, and 0.386, respectively.

AI cost ranged from Rs. 400-800/-and Rs. 500-1000/-per insemination in cows and buffaloes respectively. Breeding cost through pedigreed bull was comparable to insemination in both cows and buffaloes. Subsistence mode of livestock rearing and natural grazing on community pastures were the main reasons for low adoption rate of AI. Farmers ensured that their buffaloes were sired only through pedigreed bulls. Since, pedigreed bulls were not available in all villages, their availability in villages or at the selected farmers on payment basis is required for genetic improvement of cattle. © Indian Journal of Extension Education.},

	abstract = {Introduction of automation into agriculture has lowered production costs, reduced the drudgery of tedious manual labor, increased the level of accuracy of mechanized operations, raised the level of quality of fresh produce, and improved environmental control. Unlike industrial applications that often deal with relatively simple, repetitive, well-defined, and known a priori tasks, agriculture automation usually requires advanced technologies to deal with the relatively more complex and highly unstructured and dynamic nature of both biological produce and the environment. Since the product being dealt with is of relatively low value, the cost of the automated system must be relatively low for it to be economically justified. The seasonal nature of agriculture and the many different cultivars and crops make it difficult to achieve high utilization found in the manufacturing industries. The complex agricultural environment, combined with the intensive production require development of robust systems with fast speeds and low costs. Inherent safety and reliability are necessary.

	abstract = {Livestock farming is the most important and strategic industry for our country’s food security. In recent years, the techniques and technologies of livestock production have changed significantly. Robotic feeding, milking, harvesting and processing systems are being introduced. High-quality products require impeccable milk quality. Robotics in the process management and control systems are becoming more sophisticated and increasingly affordable. The dairy industry is changing dramatically. An integrated approach to the rational conduct of dairy business allows agricultural enterprises to advance to a more efficient level of production organization (Abeni et al. in J Dairy Sci 88:3542–3552, 2005). Robotic milking is widely accepted, especially in Western Europe, as a way to reduce workforce on dairy farms, increase production per cow and improve the lifestyle of dairy farm families milking 40–250 cows (De Koning in Automatic milking–common practice on dairy farms. pp. 52–67, 2010). The growing popularity of this technology can be seen in its rapid rate of implementation. In 2009, the estimated number of robotic dairy farms worldwide was 8000 (De Koning in Automatic milking–common practice on dairy farms. pp. 52–67, 2010). Only 6 years later (Barkema et al. in J Dairy Sci 98:7426–7445, 2015), it was suggested that this number had more than tripled to 25,000 dairy farms worldwide. The percentage of herds milked with this technology is highest in Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands (Barkema et al. in J Dairy Sci 98:7426–7445, 2015). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

In the context of agriculture robotics, it is a critical task for livestock automation to work toward condition assessment or behaviour recognition. In this work, we propose a novel approach for semantic keypoint annotation in pointclouds, by reformulating the keypoint extraction as a regression problem of the distance between the keypoints and the rest of the pointcloud. We use the distance on the pointcloud manifold mapped into a radial basis function (RBF), which is then learned using an encoder-decoder architecture. Special consideration is given to the data augmentation specific to multi-depth-camera systems by considering noise over the extrinsic calibration and camera frame dropout. Additionally, we investigate computationally efficient non-rigid deformation methods that can be applied to animal pointclouds. Our method is tested on data collected in the field, on moving beef cattle, with a calibrated system of multiple hardware-synchronised RGB-D cameras. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background and Aim: The Kacang goat (Capra hircus) is an indigenous livestock species in Indonesia that is at risk of extinction due to cross-breeding. Artificial insemination (AI) techniques are expected to increase the population of these goats. This study aimed to determine the addition of epigallocatechin-3-gallate chitosan nanoparticles (EGCG CNPs) to skim milk–egg yolk (SM–EY) extender to obtain the best possible quality of post-thawed Kacang buck semen for AI. Materials and Methods:  Fresh Kacang buck semen was diluted in SM–EY without or with the addition of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 µg of EGCG CNPs/mL extender. Extended semen was packaged in French mini straws, frooze, and stored in liquid nitrogen at −196℃ for 24 hours. Six replicates from each treatment group were thawed for catalase, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, malondialdehyde (MDA), sperm intact plasma membrane (IPM), viability and motility analyses. Results: Post-thawed semen that was previously frozen without EGCG CNPs in the extender (control group) exhibited the lowest levels of catalase, DPPH, sperm viability, sperm motility, IPM, and the highest levels of MDA. However, the addition of EGCG CNPs at doses of 1.5 µg/mL extender increased post-thawed catalase, DPPH, sperm IPM, viability, and sperm motility and decreased MDA levels (p < 0.05) than those of control group. Conclusion: This study was the first in which EGCG CNPs were used in SM–EY extender, and the addition of only 1.0 µg/mL of EGCG CNPs in this extender increased the antioxidant capacity and post-thawed quality of Kacang buck semen.

	abstract = {With the increasing demand of human and the development of automation technology, there is an urgent need for automated livestock body measurement methods. An object of this paper is to investigate an automated method for measuring body size parameters of live pigs based on non-rigid registration of point clouds. We choose Xtion pro camera as point cloud acquisition equipment to obtain RGB-D data from the upper left and upper right. Pig body point clouds are extracted from the acquired data after preprocessing. We perform coarse registration to the measured point clouds and the template point cloud so that the two point clouds are aligned. Moreover, non-rigid registration methods are used in order to make the shape of the measured data fit with the template data. Finally, the different body size parameters are estimated according to the landmarks that marked on the template point cloud in advance. The results have shown that this method is reliable for measuring pig body size parameters compared to manually measured values, especially in measuring the hip height, shoulder width, and hip width, in which the average relative errors are 2.92%, 5.78%, and 4.83%. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: The house fly, Musca domestica, is vector for pathogens and parasites and causes economic damage to livestock by reducing forage conversion efficiency, negatively impacting weight gain and milk production. It has shown resistance to multiple insecticide classes. The aim of this research was to determine the susceptibility levels of seventeen field M. domestica strains to thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide, in Türkiye. Methods: Insecticide susceptibility of the house flies to thiamethoxam was determined using the WHO glass jar method. A probit analysis program was used to determine LD50 values, and then the resistance ratios were compared with insecticide-susceptible strain. Results: All strains were ≥18.5-fold resistant to thiamethoxam. The data showed that 10 out of 17 strains had either high or very high resistance levels. Our findings revealed that house flies from solid waste landfills in Samsun, Ankara, and Kocaeli exhibited higher resistance ratios compared to those found in animal shelters. Conversely, in Gaziantep, Antalya, İzmir and Erzurum, the exact opposite trend was observed. Regarding the LD50 values among solid waste storage areas, the lowest rate was obtained from Gaziantep (0.72 gr ai/m2), and the highest rate was obtained from Ankara (9.35 gr ai/m2). Furthermore, regarding the LD50 values among animal shelters, the lowest was obtained from Samsun (0.37 gr ai/m2), and the highest was obtained from Denizli (21800 gr ai/m2). Conclusion: The use of integrated control systems is recommended for controlling house fly populations, including insecticide class rotations for preventing, or at least, delaying the onset of resistance. © 2023 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

	abstract = {India's poultry business is rapidly transitioning from a traditional home hobby to a vibrant agro-based sector with the most advanced handling facilities. Despite the fact that the accomplishments are excellent based on development standards, the work at hand remains extremely difficult. There is significant work to be done to raise a great majority of the rural people to the threshold of a reasonable standard of life in terms of nutrition, housing, health, education, and employment, all of which are income-dependent. Poultry production may considerably help to the monumental egalitarian job of providing improved health, education, and living conditions to the people, particularly in rural India. In this study, questions were posed using a survey design. The data is collected directly from the respondents through an experiment. Two approaches are utilised to acquire quantitative data: structured interviews and self-administered surveys. These areas highlight the use of AI in the livestock and poultry sectors. This essay illustrates how artificial intelligence (AI) aids agriculture by increasing employment opportunities and decreasing labour expenses. This analysis demonstrated that utilising AI will save expenses, improve product quality and feed quality, and boost animal production. Therefore, R&D (research and development) must be enhanced if we are to modernise in the domains of agriculture and other AI applications. It is essential to create new technologies to make farming and daily life simpler, as artificial intelligence has simplified the execution of our most essential agricultural chores. In this paper we provide a review for different paper based on Poultry Production. In addition, we will present an analysis of the data collected from poultry farms.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Governments and policymakers in developing nations such as Nigeria are struggling to address the issue of youth unemployment. This study, therefore, seeks to understand the prospects and constraints of the cattle farming business and its impact on employment opportunities in Kwara State, Nigeria. The theory of rational choice was used to explain the theoretical framework of the study. The study examined employees at various cattle rearing farms in Kwara state. The study made use of a descriptive survey research design combining both qualitative and quantitative techniques and respondents were selected purposively. Primary data was acquired utilizing a well-structured questionnaire as well as in-depth interviews with a sample size of 150 respondents. IDI chose twenty-two members of staff who work in the cattle rearing industry for the in-depth interview. It is established from the study that there exists a positive strong relationship between the cattle farming business and employment opportunities. One of the recommendations of the study is that government efforts to support cattle farming should be stepped up by providing contemporary Artificial Intelligence (AI) stations, as well as loan or credit incentives from commercial banks. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize the industry, making it more efficient, sustainable, and productive. AI can be used to analyze data from various sources, such as satellite imagery, drones, and sensors, to provide farmers with valuable insights. It helps in optimizing irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application by identifying areas of the field that require attention. AI algorithms can also predict crop yield, disease outbreaks, and recommend optimal planting and harvesting times. AI-powered systems can monitor crops and livestock through computer vision techniques and sensor data analysis. This enables early detection of plant diseases, nutrient deficiencies, or pest infestations. Livestock monitoring can include facial recognition to identify individual animals, behavior analysis to detect signs of illness or distress, and automated feeding systems. In developing countries like India, the rapid spread of mobile internet technology is offering a vital role in economic growth, social empowerment, and grass roots creativity. Every harvested crop needs to be transported. Transportation is one of the important factors for a farmer’s success. Transport that is well-managed is effective in transporting farm resources and harvested products as quickly as possible. So we are going to develop an android application for farmers and transport service providers. By this, we can pool the farmers according to their requirements. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

	abstract = {Deep learning algorithms particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art techniques for object detection, classification, segmentation and behaviour classification. These algorithms have extensive application across various domains including agriculture. However, cow identification in dairy farming still relies on methods like direct visual monitoring which are time consuming, costly and inaccurate; or use of invasive contact devices such as sensors which can cause discomfort during attachment or removal. This research compared three deep learning object detection models i.e. YOLOv5, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, which were selected based on their performance in object detection tasks. We generated cow images from videos captured from a housed dairy cattle barn. The dataset had 11,828 cow images, augmented to depict different illumination conditions and using makesense AI tool, we annotated the images in YOLO format, trained and validated the three models to visualize cow bounding boxes. Our approach demonstrates efficiency of the YOLOv8 model, achieving an accuracy of 94.7% and 93 % before and after data augmentation respectively. YOLOv8 baseline model was finetuned using the Ray Tune library achieving a mAP@O.50 score of 92. 9%. This research makes a significant contribution in the future research direction of the YOLO algorithm and highlights the practical implementation of deep learning models for cow detection, applicable in livestock management.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Animal sourced protein is increasing rapidly due to the growing of population and incomes. The big data, robots and smart sensing technologies have brought the autonomous robotic system to the smart farming that enhance productivity and efficiency. Therefore, a YOLOv4-SAM was proposed to achieve high detection precision of cow body parts in long-term complex scenes. The proposed YOLOv4-SAM consists of two components: YOLOv4 is for multi-scale feature extraction, while the Spatial Attention Mechanisms (SAM) highlights the key cow biometric-related features. By doing this, visual biometric feature representation ability is enhanced for improving cow detection performance. To verify the performance of YOLOv4-SAM, a challenging dataset consisting of adult cows and calves with complex environments (e.g., day and night, occlusion, multiple target) was constructed for experimental testing. The precision, recall, mIoU and of the proposed YOLOv4-CBAM were 92.29%, 96.51%, 77.22% and 93.13%, respectively. The data shows that its overall performance was better than that of the comparison algorithm (Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet and YOLOv4). In addition, object detection based on the YOLOv4-SAM model can capture the key biometric-related features for cow visual representation and improve the performance of cow detection. In addition, the detected height difference between head and leg proved the capability in automatic identification of lame cows. The proposed deep learning-based cow detection approach provides a basis for developing an automated system for animal monitoring and management on commercial dairy farms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Enteric protozoan parasites Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp., and, to a lesser extent, the ciliate Balantioides coli are responsible for severe human and animal intestinal disorders globally. However, limited information is available on the occurrence and epidemiology of these parasites in domestic, but especially wild species in Portugal. To fill this gap of knowledge, we have investigated G. duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp., and B. coli occurrence, distribution, genetic diversity, and zoonotic potential by analyzing 756 fecal samples from several wild carnivores (n = 288), wild ungulates (n = 242), and domestic species (n = 226) collected across different areas of mainland Portugal. Overall, infection rates were 16.1% (122/756; 95% CI: 13.59–18.96) for G. duodenalis and 2.7% (20/756; CI: 1.62–4.06) for Cryptosporidium spp., while no ungulate sample analyzed yielded positive results for B. coli. Giardia duodenalis was found across a wide range of hosts and sampling areas, being most prevalent in the Iberian lynx (26.7%), the Iberian wolf (24.0%), and the domestic dog (23.9%). Cryptosporidium spp. was only identified in wild boar (8.4%), red fox (3.4%), Iberian lynx (3.3%), red deer (3.1%), and Iberian wolf (2.5%). Sequence analysis of G. duodenalis determined zoonotic assemblage A (subassemblage AI) in one roe deer sample, canine-specific assemblages C and D in Iberian wolf, red fox, and domestic dog, and ungulate-specific assemblage E in wild boar, sheep, cattle, and horse. Six Cryptosporidium species were identified: C. scrofarum in wild boar, C. canis in the Iberian wolf and red fox, C. ubiquitum in red deer and wild boar, C. felis in the Iberian lynx, and both C. ryanae and C. occultus in red deer. Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. coinfections were observed in 0.7% (5/756) of the samples. This is the first, most comprehensive, and largest molecular-based epidemiology study of its kind carried out in Portugal, covering a wide range of wild and domestic hosts and sampling areas. The detection of zoonotic Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis subassemblage AI demonstrates the role of wild and domestic host species in the transmission of these agents while representing a potential source of environmental contamination for other animals and humans. © 2023 Ana M.

	abstract = {Infection with Pasteurella multocida represents a significant economic threat to Australian pig producers, yet our knowledge of its antimicrobial susceptibilities is lagging, and genomic characterization of P. multocida strains associated with porcine lower respiratory disease is internationally scarce. This study utilized high-throughput robotics to phenotypically and genetically characterize an industry-wide collection of 252 clinical P. multocida isolates that were recovered between 2014 and 2019. Overall, antimicrobial resistance was found to be low, with clinical resistance below 1% for all tested antimicrobials except those from the tetracycline class. Five dominant sequence types, representing 64.8% of all isolates, were identified; they were disseminated across farms and had previously been detected in various animal hosts and countries. P. multocida in Australian farms remain controllable via current antimicrobial therapeutic protocols. The identification of highly dominant, interspecies-infecting strains provides insight into the epidemiology of the opportunistic pathogen, and it highlights a biosecurity threat to the Australian livestock industry. IMPORTANCE Pasteurellosis is rated by the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) as a high-impact disease in livestock. Although it is well understood in many host-disease contexts, our understanding of the organism in porcine respiratory disease is limited. Given its high frequency of involvement in porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), it is important that we are aware of its antimicrobial susceptibilities so that we can respond quickly and appropriately with antimicrobial therapy. Genetic insights about the organism can help us to better understand its epidemiology and inform our biosecurity practices and prophylactic management. Copyright © 2023 Truswell et al.},

	abstract = {The present study focuses on the expected benefits and drivers that may influence the adoption of sustainable waste treatment technologies in the livestock sector, as well as enterprises’ provision for future investments pursuing sustainability. Forty-seven livestock enterprises were administered a questionnaire investigating: i) the adoption and intention to adopt strategies and technologies to reduce the environmental impact of livestock waste, ii) the expenses they incurred, iii) the frequency of exposure to various information sources, and iv) the perceived drivers and benefits. The results showed that 66% of the respondents adopted sustainable technology solutions to manage livestock waste aimed at recovering nutrients or reducing GHG emissions. The expected benefits in adopting sustainable technologies are firstly “the improved soil fertility and soil organic matter content”. For those enterprises that do not adopt any of the proposed technologies, the rising prices of mineral fertilizers and the possibility of producing on-farm bioenergy would be the main drivers to adoption. The average expense for initial investment is 20–50 k€, primarily funded by enterprises’ own capital and secondarily by rural development programs. Forty-three percent of the respondents expressed their intention to continue investing in the future, primarily on “high-precision distribution systems for slurry on-field application” and “automated systems for the management of waste within the livestock house”. Results from the present survey are a valuable baseline to develop and disseminate targeted information on implications and opportunities for sustainable livestock treatment systems, addressing policy makers, farmers’ trade associations, and technology providers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Background: With the advent of AI technology, great strides have been made in the realm of animal healthcare. This article delves into the numerous uses of AI in veterinary medicine and demonstrates its revolutionary potential in the field. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have shown impressive skills in illness detection, using medical imaging analysis to help veterinarians discover and categorise diseases with greater accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, predictive analytics algorithms use various data sources, such as electronic health records and genetic profiles, to recognise trends and forecast illness outbreaks, allowing veterinarians to remotely monitor vital signs and act swiftly paving the way for preventative measures and individualised treatment. Methods: The purpose of this article is to offer a synopsis of the many ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to improve the health and well-being of animals. Understanding the effects of AI in animal healthcare and setting the stage for its further development will be accomplished via an examination of the present state of the subject. Result: It is evident that through mountains of data from studies and clinical trials, AI is helping to speed up the discovery of novel treatments and improve the understanding of animal health. A responsible and useful application of AI in animal healthcare requires the establishment of ethical concerns, data protection and regulatory frameworks. © 2023 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {Rural areas, which account for about 90% of the country’s land area, are increasing in importance and value as a space that performs various public functions. However, facilities that adversely affect residents’ lives, such as livestock facilities, factories, and solar panels, are being built indiscriminately near residential areas, damaging the rural environment and landscape and lowering the quality of residents’ lives. In order to prevent disorderly development in rural areas and manage rural space in a planned manner, detection and monitoring of hazardous facilities in rural areas is necessary. Data can be acquired through satellite imagery, which can be acquired periodically and provide information on the entire region. Effective detection is possible by utilizing image-based deep learning techniques using convolutional neural networks. Therefore, U-Net model, which shows high performance in semantic segmentation, was used to classify potentially hazardous facilities in rural areas. In this study, KOMPSAT ortho-mosaic optical imagery provided by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute in 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0.7 meters was used, and AI training data for livestock facilities, factories, and solar panels were produced by hand for training and inference. After training with U-Net, pixel accuracy of 0.9739 and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.7025 were achieved. The results of this study can be used for monitoring hazardous facilities in rural areas and are expected to be used as basis for rural planning.

	abstract = {Technologies for automating animal management and monitoring tasks can improve efficiency and productivity of livestock production. We developed the e-Synch system for automated control and monitoring the estrous cycle of cattle through intravaginal hormone delivery and sensing. Thus, our objective was to evaluate luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations after intravaginal instillation of the Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue Gonadorelin with the e-Synch system. This system consists of an intravaginal electronically controlled automated hormone delivery and sensing device integrated with an IoT platform. Lactating Holstein cows with their estrous cycle synchronized were used in two experiments (Exp). In Exp 1, at 48 h after induction of luteolysis, cows (n=5-6 per group) were randomized to receive 100 µg of Gonadorelin through intramuscular (i.m.) injection, 100 µg of Gonadorelin in a 2 mL solution delivered with e-Synch, and an empty e-Synch device. In Exp 2, at 48 h after induction of luteolysis cows (n=6-7 per group) were randomized to receive 100 µg of Gonadorelin i.m., or an intravaginal treatment with e-Synch consisting of 100 or 1,000 µg of Gonadorelin in 2 or 10 mL of solution containing 10% citric acid as absorption enhancer. Circulating concentrations of LH were analyzed with linear mixed models with or without repeated measurements. In Exp 1, cows in the i.m. Gonadorelin treatment had a surge of LH whereas cows in the other two treatments did not have a surge of LH for up to 8 h after treatment. In Exp 2, the 1,000 µg dose of Gonadorelin elicited more LH release than the 100 µg dose, regardless of solution quantity. The overall LH response as determined by area under the curve, mean, and maximum LH concentrations was similar between cows receiving 1,000 µg of Gonadorelin delivered with e-Synch and 100 μg of Gonadorelin i.m. Increasing volume of solution for delivering the same dose of Gonadorelin partially increased LH release only for the 100 µg dose. We conclude that the e-Synch system could be used to automatically release Gonadorelin in a dose and volume that induces a surge of LH of similar magnitude than after i.m. injection of 100 μg of Gonadorelin. Also, the dose of Gonadorelin delivered by e-Synch is more critical than the volume of solution used. Copyright © 2023 Ren, Duhatschek, Bartolomeu, Laplacette, Perez, Rial, Erickson and Giordano.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the outline of the Farming Management System (FMS) in Mongolia, including the result of the experiment of the FMS, the methodological framework of Good Agricultural Practice (GAPs), a remote monitoring system, and AI for decision-making. We are now developing the FMS to support cow farms in Mongolia. The main goal is to produce verified milk and meat production for people. So, the system includes all functionalities to track farm cows’ life cycle, including veterinary service, forage, well-being, and farm environment. The FMS is a cloud-based system that allows farmers to access a smartphone and PC over the internet. The FMS provides functionalities such as delivering farm information, livestock registration, calculating livestock profit, calculating forage, providing veterinary service, hygiene management, breeding management, selection management, and developing farming management reports. One of the essential functionalities is to realize a traceability system for milk and meat production. Also, the system functionalities are being developed based on GAPs, which are the primary guidance to produce healthy and verified food. The government of Mongolia has aimed to implement GAPs standards since 2018. According to GAPs standards, all farms must track the livestock’s life cycle from birth to death, registering and analyzing the data daily. GAPs standards require farms to manage their livestock scientifically and realize the well-being of livestock. Several factors measure well-being, such as animal houses, pastures, and medical services. It is necessary to track livestock behavior and health conditions automatically and remotely using IoT sensors and LPWA technology to realize GAPs. AI analyzes collected data to classify livestock behavior and estimate product value. The AI supports making the most appropriate decision in different situations, such as location, weather, and season. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

India is gradually acquiring experience with the use of drones for crop protection. Crop health is closely monitored in real time using drone and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. The usage of drones is also employed for variable rate technologies. Urban Agriculture (UA) is involved in the production of food grains, fruits, flowers, vegetables, and livestock products in urban environments like cities and towns. In addition to the issue of the expanding urban population, it addresses the question of sustainable development. Along with the aforementioned objectives, UA must also support the Sustainable Development Goals set forth by the UNO by recycling urban trash, using efficient water resources, conserving energy, reducing air pollution and soil erosion, and making cities more beautiful. The main focus of this paper is on implementing a multi-faceted approach to support the UA, which includes raising production through the development of resources for better irrigation, using inputs effectively, lowering post-harvest losses, adding value and reforming agriculture. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Precision livestock farming (PLF) offers a strategic solution to enhance the management capacity of large animal groups, while simultaneously improving profitability, efficiency, and minimizing environmental impacts associated with livestock production systems. Additionally, PLF contributes to optimizing the ability to manage and monitor animal welfare while providing solutions to global grand challenges posed by the growing demand for animal products and ensuring global food security. By enabling a return to the "per animal"approach by harnessing technological advancements, PLF enables cost-effective, individualized care for animals through enhanced monitoring and control capabilities within complex farming systems. Meeting the nutritional requirements of a global population exponentially approaching ten billion people will likely require the density of animal proteins for decades to come. The development and application of digital technologies are critical to facilitate the responsible and sustainable intensification of livestock production over the next several decades to maximize the potential benefits of PLF. Real-time continuous monitoring of each animal is expected to enable more precise and accurate tracking and management of health and well-being. Importantly, the digitalization of agriculture is expected to provide collateral benefits of ensuring auditability in value chains while assuaging concerns associated with labor shortages. Despite notable advances in PLF technology adoption, a number of critical concerns currently limit the viability of these state-of-the-art technologies. The potential benefits of PLF for livestock management systems which are enabled by autonomous continuous monitoring and environmental control can be rapidly enhanced through an Internet of Things approach to monitoring and (where appropriate) closed-loop management. In this paper, we analyze the multilayered network of sensors, actuators, communication, networking, and analytics currently used in PLF, focusing on dairy farming as an illustrative example. We explore the current state-of-the-art, identify key shortcomings, and propose potential solutions to bridge the gap between technology and animal agriculture. Additionally, we examine the potential implications of advancements in communication, robotics, and artificial intelligence on the health, security, and welfare of animals. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed many great successes of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) applications in agricultural systems, including weed control, plant disease diagnosis, agricultural robotics, and precision livestock management. Despite tremendous progresses, one downside of such ML/DL models is that they generally rely on large-scale labeled datasets for training, and the performance of such models is strongly influenced by the size and quality of available labeled data samples. In addition, collecting, processing, and labeling such large-scale datasets is extremely costly and time-consuming, partially due to the rising cost in human labor. Therefore, developing label-efficient ML/DL methods for agricultural applications has received significant interests among researchers and practitioners. In fact, there are more than 50 papers on developing and applying deep-learning-based label-efficient techniques to address various agricultural problems since 2016, which motivates the authors to provide a timely and comprehensive review of recent label-efficient ML/DL methods in agricultural applications. To this end, we first develop a principled taxonomy to organize these methods according to the degree of supervision, including weak supervision (i.e., active learning and semi-/weakly- supervised learning), and no supervision (i.e., un-/selfsupervised learning), supplemented by representative state-of-the-art label-efficient ML/DL methods. In addition, a systematic review of various agricultural applications exploiting these label-efficient algorithms, such as plant health, weed and crop management, fruit detection, and aquaculture, is presented. Finally, we discuss the current problems and challenges, as well as future research directions.

Based on the 3D acceleration data measured by the cow's rumen bolus, the heart characteristics, namely the InterBeat Intervals (IBI) values and the derived Heart Rate (HR) frequency values were detected. The task is made more difficult by the fact that motion artifacts from other movements (walking, jumping, rumination) measured by the sensor typically have a larger amplitude than the signal generated by heart activity. The detection was carried out with a sampling frequency of 25Hz in the ±2G measurement range and the calculations were performed on a time series measured at 3s. During processing, the IBI values could be detected with an accuracy of ±50ms using data pre-filtering, Wavelet-Morlet transformation and Kalman filtering. The obtained results are suitable for implementing basic alarms (stress, illness, beginning of calving) in a Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) system. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unregulated livestock breeding and grazing can degrade grasslands and damage the ecological environment. The combination of remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques is a more convenient and powerful means to acquire livestock information in a large area than traditional manual ground investigation. As a mainstream remote sensing platform, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can obtain high-resolution optical images to detect grazing livestock in grassland. However, grazing livestock objects in UAV images usually occupy very few pixels and tend to gather together, which makes them difficult to detect and count automatically. This paper proposes the GLDM (grazing livestock detection model), a lightweight and high-accuracy deep-learning model, for detecting grazing livestock in UAV images. The enhanced CSPDarknet (ECSP) and weighted aggregate feature re-extraction pyramid modules (WAFR) are constructed to improve the performance based on the YOLOX-nano network scheme. The dataset of different grazing livestock (12,901 instances) for deep learning was made from UAV images in the Hadatu Pasture of Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, China. The results show that the proposed method achieves a higher comprehensive detection precision than mainstream object detection models and has an advantage in model size. The (Formula presented.) of the proposed method is 86.47%, with the model parameter 5.7 M. The average recall and average precision can be above 85% at the same time. The counting accuracy of grazing livestock in the testing dataset, when converted to a unified sheep unit, reached 99%. The scale applicability of the model is also discussed, and the GLDM could perform well with the image resolution varying from 2.5 to 10 cm. The proposed method, the GLDM, was better for detecting grassland grazing livestock in UAV images, combining remote sensing, AI, and grassland ecological applications with broad application prospects. © 2023 by the authors.},

The aim of this study was to propose a deep learning-based model for recognising cow behaviours and to determine critical thresholds for the onset of heat stress at the herd level.

Three YOLOv5 architectures were trained by the transfer learning method. The results show the superiority of YOLOv5s with a mean average precision of 0.985 and an inference speed of 73 frames per second on the testing set. Further validation demonstrates excellent agreement in herd-level behavioural parameters between automated measurement and manual observation (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.97). The analysis of automated behavioural measurements during a 10-day experiment with no to moderate heat stress reveals that lying and standing indices were most responding to heat stress and the test dairy herd began to change their behaviour at the earliest ambient temperature of 23.8 °C or temperature-humidity index of 68.5. Time effects were observed to alter the behavioural indicators values rather than their corresponding environmental thresholds. The proposed method enables a low-cost herd-level heat stress alert without imposing any burden on dairy cows. © 2023 IAgrE},

	abstract = {Some sectors of animal production and reproduction have shown great technological advances due to the development of research areas such as Precision Livestock Farming (PLF). PLF is an innovative approach that allows animals to be monitored, through the adoption of cutting-edge technologies that continuously collect real-time data by combining the use of sensors with advanced algorithms to provide decision tools for farmers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field that merges computer science and large datasets to create expert systems that are able to generate predictions and classifications similarly to human intelligence. In a simplified manner, Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI, and can be considered as a broader field that encompasses Deep Learning (DL, a Neural Network formed by at least three layers), generating a hierarchy of subsets formed by AI, ML and DL, respectively. Both ML and DL provide innovative methods for analyzing data, especially beneficial for large datasets commonly found in livestock-related activities. These approaches enable the extraction of valuable insights to address issues related to behavior, health, reproduction, production, and the environment, facilitating informed decision-making. In order to create the referred technologies, studies generally go through five steps involving data processing: acquisition, transferring, storage, analysis and delivery of results. Although the data collection and analysis steps are usually thoroughly reported by the scientific community, a good execution of each step is essential to achieve good and credible results, which impacts the degree of acceptance of the proposed technologies in real life practical circumstances. In this context, the present work aims to describe an overview of the current implementations of ML/DL in livestock reproduction and production, as well to identify potential challenges and critical points in each of the five steps mentioned, which can affect results and application of AI techniques by farmers in practical situations. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted nd reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

	abstract = {Giardia duodenalis is a zoonotic protozoan parasite that causes gastrointestinal illness in humans and livestock. We studied the genetic diversity of G. duodenalis in children and calves from Bangladesh to determine its zoonotic potential. Fecal samples collected from children (299) and calves (699) were screened with nested PCR with primers targeting the ssu rRNA gene for G. duodenalis. Positive samples were further multilocus genotyped using the β-giardin (bg), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) genes. The overall infection rate of G. duodenalis was 21.1% (63/299) in children and 5.7% (40/ 699) in calves. There were no significant diferences in infection with G. duodenalis among age groups, sex, and study areas in children and calves. Multilocus genotyping (MLG) of human G. duodenalis identified zoonotic assemblages A (34.0%, 18/53) and B (50.9%, 27/53) and a so-called ruminant-specific assemblage E (11.3%, 6/53), as well as two mixed assemblages, B/D (1/53) and B/E (1/53). Assemblage E predominated in calves (82.3%, 28/34), followed by assemblages A (11.8%, 4/34) and B (5.9%, 2/34). Overall, zoonotic assemblages A, B, and E were found in 6.0% (18/299), 9.0% (27/299), and 2.0% (6/299) of the children’s stool samples, respectively, and 0.6% (4/699), 0.3% (2/699), and 4.0% (28/699) of the calf fecal samples, respectively. Although there was a diference in the distribution of subassemblages in humans (mostly AII) and calves (mostly AI), the zoonotic assemblages A, B, and E present in both children and calves suggest the potential for zoonotic transmission of G. duodenalis. This molecular study highlights the fact that G. duodenalis infections were common in the study areas, with potential zoonotic transmission between children and calves, implying that cattle might play a role in G. duodenalis zoonotic transmission. © 2023 Junqiang Li et al.},

	abstract = {The body condition of dairy cows is a crucial health and welfare indicator that is widely acknowledged. Dairy herds with a well-management body condition tend to have more fertile and functional cows. Therefore, routine recording of high-quality body condition phenotypes is required. Automated prediction of body condition from 3D images can be a cost-effective approach to current manual recording by technicians. Using 3D-images, we aimed to build a reliable prediction model of body condition for Jersey cows. The dataset consisted of 808 individual Jersey cows with 2, 253 phenotypes from three herds in Denmark. Body condition was scored on a 1 to 9 scale and transformed into a 1 to 5 scale with 0.5-unit differences. The cows’ back images were recorded using a 3D camera (Microsoft Xbox One Kinect v2). We used contour and back height features from 3D-images as predictors, together with class predictors (evaluator, herd, evaluation round, parity, lactation week). The performance of machine learning algorithms was assessed using H2O AutoML algorithm (h2o.ai). Based on outputs from AutoML, DeepLearning (DL; multilayer feedforward artificial neural network) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithms were implemented for classification and regression tasks and compared on prediction accuracy. In addition, we compared the Partial Least Square (PLS) method for regression. The training and validation data were divided either through a random 7:3 split for 10 replicates or by allocating two herds for training and one herd for validation. The accuracy of classification models showed the DL algorithm performed better than the GBM algorithm. The DL model achieved a mean accuracy of 48.1% on the exact phenotype and 93.5% accuracy with a 0.5-unit deviation. The performances of PLS and DL regression methods were comparable, with mean coefficient of determination of 0.67 and 0.66, respectively. When we used data from two herds for training and the third herd as validation, we observed a slightly decreased prediction accuracy compared to the 7:3 split of the dataset. The accuracies for DL and PLS in the herd validation scenario were > 38% on the exact phenotype and > 87% accuracy with 0.5-unit deviation. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a reliable body condition prediction model in Jersey cows using 3D-images. The approach developed can be used for reliable and frequent prediction of cows’ body condition to improve dairy farm management and genetic evaluations. © The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {Consumption of aflatoxin-contaminated food can cause severe illness when consumed by humans or livestock. Because the mycotoxin frequently occurs in cereal grains and other agricultural crops, it is crucial to develop portable devices that can be used non-destructively and in real-time to identify aflatoxin-contaminated food materials during early stages of harvesting or processing. In this study, an aflatoxin detection method was developed using a compact Raman device that can be used in the field. Data were obtained using maize samples naturally contaminated with aflatoxin, and the data were analyzed using a machine learning method. Of the multiple classification models evaluated, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), linear support vector machines (LSVM), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and quadratic support vector machines and spectral preprocessing methods, the best classification accuracy was achieved at 95.7% using LDA in combination with Savitzky-Golay 2nd derivative (SG2) preprocessing. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models demonstrated a close-range accuracy within the scope of standard normal variate (SNV) and multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) preprocessing methods, with determination of coefficient values of R2C and R2V of 0.9998 and 0.8322 respectively for SNV, and 0.9916 and 0.8387 respectively for MSC. This study demonstrates the potential use of compact and automated Raman spectroscopy, coupled with chemometrics and machine learning methods, as a tool for rapidly screening food and feed for hazardous substances at on-site field processing locations. © 2023},

	abstract = {Introduction: Women play important roles in the dairy sector in Tanzania yet many women face local gender norms which inhibit them from benefitting from their enterprises. This affects women’s empowerment and the development of effective livestock businesses. Methods: This study addresses the question: How do women’s empowerment and gender norms affect women’s engagement in livestock business? To respond, this study explores how women attempt to negotiate gender norms in order to create a niche for their agribusiness, and thereby to empower themselves. Since gender norms are diverse, research was undertaken in 2021 with agripreneurs running dairy-related businesses in two regions of Tanzania. Gender-disaggregated focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and individual interviews were carried out in Kilimanjaro and Tanga regions which had been target sites for the bigger Maziwa Zaidi Phase II project in Tanzania. In total, 24 women dairy farmers, 25 men dairy farmers, 20 women agripreneurs and 22 men agripreneurs involved in selling feeds, milk collection and agro-veterinary goods and services such as artificial insemination and livestock extension participated in the FGDs. Twelve women and 16 men were interviewed as KIIs while 12 women and 15 men were interviewed individually. Results and Discussion: The findings show that women agripreneurs are active in selling milk and earning an income, and a few women provide AI services. However, local gender norms significantly reduce potential gains. Normative sanctions are applied to women who are perceived to be moving beyond acceptable gender norms in their efforts to establish their dairy related livelihoods. Yet this picture is not uniform. The presence of traditionally more favorable local gender norms towards engagement in smallholder dairy related businesses allows women in the Kilimanjaro Region to openly exercise more decision-making power and secure more benefits compared to women in Tanga Region where local norms largely limited women’s engagement because dairying is a rather novel concept and was introduced in the 1990s as a men’s income generation enterprise. Our own findings indicate that local patriarchal contexts remain powerful in both study sites. However with sustained empowerment efforts, women and men fairly express an understanding of empowerment as a process, involving building capacity, supporting, creating an enabling environment for achieving of one’s goals. Women note that an empowered woman faces more barriers than an empowered man because if married, she has to consult with her husband prior to making big investments. Empowered men are however free to do as they like with their resources. Patriarchal norms guiding social ordering in Tanzania therefore place a cap on achievement as well as expression of empowerment by women. Moreover, through gender norms gatekeeping, significant relations such as husbands and community members can also act as empowerment gatekeepers reining in women’s expression and experience of empowerment, especially if her husband is economically disempowered while she is.

	abstract = {Dairy cows are usually culled and transported from the farm when they no longer meet the farm’s standards for production or are not needed for milk production. Some cows are transported while in poor condition and may deteriorate further during transport. In February 2020, Canadian federal animal transport regulations were revised with the aim to minimise risks to livestock during transport; changes that may impact cull dairy cows included defining compromised cattle and limiting their maximum transport time. This study conducted semi-structured interviews with dairy farmers (n = 6) and cattle haulers (n = 4) in British Columbia, Canada, to gain an in-depth understanding of the effect of the regulations on their practices when shipping and transporting dairy cows to slaughter. Interviews were transcribed in Otter.ai and thematically coded in NVivo 12. While farmer and hauler participants recognised the importance of animal welfare during transport and described practices such as shipping mobile animals to reduce the risk that cows would become non-ambulatory during transport, they also described little change in shipping and transport practices due to the new regulations. Among interviewed participants, barriers to compliance with the regulations appear to be low knowledge of, and mixed or negative attitudes towards the regulations. Participants also described how they felt a lack of communication along the transport chain and limited transport and slaughter infrastructure made compliance difficult. Possible suggestions to remedy these barriers include providing educational resources about the regulations and encouraging communication about cow fitness for transport between responsible parties in the transport chain. © Crown Copyright - The University of British Columbia, 2023.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The use of automation and sensor-based systems in livestock production allows monitoring of individual cows in real-time and provides the possibility of early warning systems to take necessary management actions against possible anomalies. Among the different RT monitoring parameters, body weight (BW) plays an important role in tracking the productivity and health status. Methods: In this study, various supervised learning techniques representing different families of methods in the machine learning space were implemented and compared for performance in the prediction of body weight from 3D image data in dairy cows. A total of 83,011 records of contour data from 3D images and body weight measurements taken from a total of 914 Danish Holstein and Jersey cows from 3 different herds were used for the predictions. Various metrics including Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used for robust evaluation of the various supervised techniques and to facilitate comparison with other studies. Prediction was undertaken separately within each breed and subsequently in a combined multi-breed dataset. Results and discussion: Despite differences in predictive performance across the different supervised learning techniques and datasets (breeds), our results indicate reasonable prediction accuracies with mean correlation coefficient (r) as high as 0.94 and MAPE and RMSE as low as 4.0 % and 33.0 (kg), respectively. In comparison to the within-breed analyses (Jersey, Holstein), prediction using the combined multi-breed data set resulted in higher predictive performance in terms of high correlation coefficient and low MAPE. Additional tests showed that the improvement in predictive performance is mainly due to increase in data size from combining data rather than the multi-breed nature of the combined data. Of the different supervised learning techniques implemented, the tree-based group of supervised learning techniques (Catboost, AdaBoost, random forest) resulted in the highest prediction performance in all the metrics used to evaluate technique performance. Reported prediction errors in our study (RMSE and MAPE) are one of the lowest in the literature for prediction of BW using image data in dairy cattle, highlighting the promising predictive value of contour data from 3D images for BW in dairy cows under commercial farm conditions.

	abstract = {Viral infection is a major devastating challenge in the livestock industry. Hardy to completely eradicate the virus, the emergence of new variants accompanied by high morbidity and mortality further substantiates the problems in poultry, ruminant, and swine farms. Notifiable diseases caused by virus infection such as avian influenza (AI), infectious bursal disease (IBD), Newcastle disease (ND), foot and mouth disease (FMD), Aujeszky’s disease, classical swine fever (CSF), and other viral diseases are controlled by vaccination, proper husbandry, and strict biosecurity. The nutritional factors also play a pivotal role in ensuring optimum growth and immunity of the livestock as well as safeguarding sustain-able food security as a protein source to human. Continuous global demand requires crucial maintenance of the good quality and value of livestock-based protein. It could be achieved by keeping the livestock in constant good health and by receiving proper and adequate nutrition. In order to fulfill the needs, feed additives are designed to be supplemented to animal feeds to improve the feed taste, stabilize gut microbes and to compensate nutritional deficiencies. In addi-tion, feed additives function as antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer and exert immunostimulatory effects in combating pathogen. In this chapter, antiviral effects of feed additives are discussed by categories, namely, nutritional additives, zootechnical additives, natural additives, technological additives, and sensory additives. Most of the antiviral effects of the additives are studied for the usage in livestock, while some examples of additives are based on human virus studies, which could be potentially utilized for further usage in future in livestock. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {Effective security systems in rural South Africa are particularly challenging due to the rugged terrain and large areas in need of securing. The security of these areas is vital as they contribute greatly to the nation's food security and tourism industry. The need for an effective security system in these areas is evident when examining the crime statistics regarding livestock theft and poaching. This paper proposes the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Robot Operating System (ROS), and the PX4 flight stack for automated alarm response, mission execution, and precise landings. We show that the automation is effective by simulating an alarm scenario and demonstrating the automation's use in subsequent landing tests. The landing precision was quantified by the mean position error measured from the centre of a landing target and was found as 0.193m with a standard deviation of 0.064m. The small standard deviation indicates that the landing precision was highly repeatable. This showed a considerable improvement over GPS-based landings, which yielded an average deviation of 0.910m with a standard deviation of 0.424m. The standard deviation here clearly indicated that traditional GPS-based landings were unsuitable for this application. The use of analogue video transmission and telemetry radios allowed the proposed solution to function in areas without any existing network infrastructure. Our results show that a low-cost UAV system can be created to address the concerns related to alarm response times in rural South Africa. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Context: The introduction of bio-sensors for monitoring real-time changes in physiological variables has helped understand how external factors affect an animal's resiliency to stressors. Aims: To quantify changes in temperature, heart rate, and locomotor activity in ewes during hormonal treatments for artificial insemination (AI) for up to 15 days after insemination. Method: Twelve ewes received a surgically implanted subcutaneous bio-logger to record data every 5 min. One week later, ewes received an intravaginal sponge for 12 days and AI was performed 54 ± 1 h after sponge withdrawal. The data were divided into the following four periods: 'sponge in' (Days -14 to -2), 'day before AI' (Day -1), 'day AI' (Day 0), and 'post-AI' (Days 1-5, Days 6-10, and Days 11-15). Key results: Ewes presented significantly (P < 0.001) higher mean temperature and activity, and a lower heart rate when the sponges were in place than they did in the days following AI. Mean body temperature in the 'sponge in' period and the 'day before AI', but not in 'post-AI period', differed significantly (P < 0.001) between pregnant and non-pregnant ewes. Non-pregnant ewes had a significantly (P < 0.001) higher heart rate than did pregnant ewes when sponges were in and in the 'post-AI' period. Non-pregnant ewes were significantly (P < 0.001) less active than were pregnant ewes in the 'sponge in' period and on Days 1-5 after AI; however, the former were significantly (P < 0.001) more active than were pregnant ewes on Days 11-15 after AI. Conclusions: The subcutaneous bio-logger system documented 24-h variations in body temperature, heart rate, and locomotor activity before and after AI in ewes that had received an estrus-synchronising hormonal treatment. Pregnancy status affected those variables and their circadian fluctuations at the time of the hormonal treatment and in the 'post-AI' period. Implications: Any device designed for use in the study of Precision Livestock Farming that allows a simple, non-invasive measurement of these variables might provide the basis for the development of a system that could identify females that are in an optimal state for insemination, and provide an early pregnancy prediction system.  © 2023 CSIRO.

	abstract = {The objectives of the present study were to elucidate the importance of follicle sizes and estrous signs during Controlled Internal Drug Release-Synch-human Chorionic Gonadotropin (CIDR-Synch-hCG) protocol for Fixed Time Artificial Insemination (FTAI) and to evaluate their association with pregnancy in water buffaloes. Data from riverine buffaloes (n = 207) under the CIDR-Synch-hCG protocol were analyzed. Buffaloes were administered with Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) with insertion of CIDR on Day 0. Prostaglandin (PGF2α) was given on Day 7 with the removal of CIDR. hCG was given on Day 9, and AI was performed on Day 10. Follicle measurements by ultrasonography were done on Days 0, 7, and 10, and follicle sizes on those days were categorized into I, II, and III. Estrus signs were taken on the day of AI. The pregnancy diagnosis was done on Day 30-35 post-AI. The average size of follicles in Category III is significantly higher than those of Categories I and II, regardless of the Days of the protocol. Pregnancy is significantly (P<0.001) associated with Pre-Ovulatory Follicle (POF) size and uterine tonicity on the Day of AI but not with follicle sizes on Days 0 and 7, nor with mucus discharge discharge (P>0.05). The overall pregnancy rate is 44.44% while performing AI with POF size ≥12.0 mm increased the probability of pregnancy rate to 56.25%. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a follicle size-based CIDR-Synch-hCG protocol providing new fertility indicators to improve FTAI efficiency in buffaloes with huge application in other livestock species. © 2023 Atabay et al.; Licensee Lifescience Global.},

	abstract = {Estrus detection in water buffalo is affected by the high incidence of poor manifestation inherent in this animal species. This affected the success rate of Artificial Insemination (AI) and Embryo Transfer (ET) due to the failure of perfect timing in AI and embryo-recipient synchrony in ET. While various ways of estrus detection were reported, the accuracy was interfered with by other symptoms that signify the health condition rather than the reproductive status of the animal. This results in a low conception rate and long calving intervals in AI and ET programs. Vaginal Cytology is a simple clinical tool of estrus detection that can also detect the pathological status of the reproductive tract and the perfect time for AI. While this is greatly used in canines, application in large animals was limited. The need to collect the swab from animals in the field and bring the smeared sample for analysis to the laboratory hindered its use and application. Our study, however, showed that by adopting this tool in estrus detection, increase in conception rate and calf production were achieved. A >60.0% cornification with the presence of >10 mm Graafian follicle is enough indicators of the perfect time for AI resulting in 80-100% conception. The development of a water buffalo vaginal chart helped determine the time of estrus. Strategies to adopt this tool for improved livestock reproduction are warranted.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Feed-pushing robots with an active working organ used on farms show low efficiency as they have fewer runs per day compared to other types of robots due to the high energy costs for self-propulsion, mixing, feed pushing and adding concentrate having larger capacity of batteries. At the same time, according to livestock requirements in farms, the number of runs per day should be no less than ten. However, in the conditions of ordinary operation, it does not even reach the values stated by the manufacturers themselves. AIMS: Study of the possibility of increasing the duration of the working process of a feed pusher robot with an active working organ by increasing the number of its runs in ordinary operation. METHODS: The research was carried out on two robotic farms, where three feed pusher robots with an active working organ operate. The robot’s current consumers are analyzed, the analytical method based on stopwatch works is presented. RESULTS: The obtained analytical expression for determining the number of runs per day nday, as well as stopwatch works, show the convergence of the results and define nday equal to 7 for a feed pusher robot with an active working organ in the conditions of ordinary operation. It has been established that in order to increase the number of runs of a feed pusher robot with an active working body, it is necessary to make it operate at the maximal possible velocity (with timely maintenance and ensuring the necessary roughness of the floor of the feed passage) or to install powerful batteries and replace or upgrade charging stations. At the same time, it is possible to achieve the result of nday=10 in ordinary operation conditions at lr =100 m, whereas at lr=300 m it is necessary to install two robots working synchronously in one aisle. The absence or presence of an additional option in the form of a concentrate dispenser does not affect the nday parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The study of the working process of a feed pusher robot with an active working organ shows that the number of its runs per day claimed by the manufacturer does not correspond to the values in the conditions of ordinary operation on a farm. Experimental studies show that nday=7, and it is possible to achieve the nday=10 declared by the manufacturer only on farms with lr=100 m, and it is necessary to install two robots working synchronously in one aisle on farms with lr=300 m. To increase the nday value, timely maintenance is necessary to maintain the maximal possible operating velocity, as well as the installation of even more powerful batteries and replacement or modernization of charging stations. © Eco-Vector, 2023 Article can be used under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 International License.},

The proposed system consists of two gas sensors MQ135 and MQ4 to capture the odors emitted by the meat samples, an ESP32-CAM, and an Arduino UNO microcontroller to process the sensor data and extract relevant features. A machine learning model is trained using a dataset of labeled meat samples with known freshness levels. The proposed technique accurately categorizes the freshness of meat samples with a classification accuracy of over 90%, showing the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in improving the precision and effectiveness of this procedure. The technology is transportable and compatible with current meat processing equipment. This gives the food business a dependable, automated method to raise the security and caliber of meat goods. Overall, the study's findings show that the suggested system is a reliable way to classify the freshness of meat. This project proposes a novel approach to detect meat freshness using two gas sensors along with a camera that employs image processing AI techniques to overcome challenges posed by added color in meat. Although there were some limitations regarding Data Availability, Subjectivity of freshness Determination and many other real-time assessments. Despite the limitations the ML and AI can help to mitigate some of the limitations and improve overall performance.  © 2023 IEEE.},

AIMS: Development of a conceptual model of an automatic cattle feeding system based on a wheeled robotic feeder for servicing animals on domestic farms and plants. METHODS: The development was based on the following studies: the analysis of products made by manufacturers of systems for the preparation and distribution of feed mixtures at cattle farms; studying the works of foreign scientists devoted to the research of automatic feeding systems; modeling the operation of a robotic feeder and a mobile feed mixer-distributor using the developed mathematical apparatus based on graph theory; the experiments carried out at Russian farms with functioning automatic feeding systems and at farms that are potential consumers of these technologies. RESULTS: The paper presents the results of statistical processing of information obtained during the review of robotic feeders made by the world’s leading manufacturers. It is noted that the existing AFSs are suitable for relatively small European farms. For Russian farms, capable to contain 800 or more cows, the structure of the AFS with two main configurations is proposed. A description of each of the configurations is given, the schematic implementation plan for one of the configurations is given. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed AFS makes it possible to effectively use robotic feed dispensers with a relatively small amount of required technological equipment. Its efficiency increases with an increase in the number of livestock serviced, especially in farms with combined animal husbandry, as the specific costs of technological equipment per head decrease. © Eco-Vector, 2023.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy is the best option for the challenge of dwindling natural resources and energy scarcity. The utilization of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is the best option for eliminating the energy deficit in Tanzania due to the available great potential of solar energy. Animal manure is a significant source of waste in rural locations which can be transformed into biogas fuel by an anaerobic process. Livestock and agriculture greatly support economically the majority of the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region's rural population including Tanzania, and excreta from cattle are beneficial for biogas fuel production. Unfortunately, the high potential of animal waste for generating electricity is underutilized. Integrating solar energy sources and biogas fuel derived from animal manure is useful for mitigating energy shortage, power instability, and environmental issues. Off-grid solar PV biogas-based hybrid microgrid systems for rural electrification applications in the Tanzanian environment are limited, and also, most of the studies are extensively carried out using soft computing tools especially hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources (HOMER) software with limited applications of artificial intelligence (AI) optimization techniques. This paper presents technoeconomic viability analysis for a hybrid renewable energy supply system (HRESS) for the Simboya village in Mbeya region, Tanzania. Off-grid HRESS is designed and optimized to meet the load of the chosen location executed using HOMER software and the grey wolf optimization (GWO) method. The microgrid is anticipated to supply daily maximum demand of 63.41 kW. The residential load profile equals 30 kW representing 50% of the daily demand. Optimization results by the HOMER platform indicate that the system has a total net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $106,383.50 and $0.1109/kWh, respectively. Furthermore, this paper presents the optimization and sensitivity analysis results acquired by the GWO method under varied values of Loss of Electrical Power Probability (LEPP). Total NPC and LCOE based on LEPP values of 0, 0.04, and 0.06 are $85,106.8, $79,545.99, and $71,747.36 and $0.0887/kWh, $0.0316/kWh, and $0.0102/kWh, respectively. HRESS is economically and environmentally beneficial for supplying electricity to the selected area and worldwide in similar situations. © 2023 Isaka J. Mwakitalima et al.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an efficient feeding system by developing a Total Mixed Ration (TMR) feeding robot considering the livestock environment for feeding the most important the cattle industry as the first stage of smart farm. In the domestic sheep cattle industry, the proportion of small farms nationwide is high. In the case of large farms, efficient feeding is efficiently provided through the operation of stationary equipment. However, the efficiency and productivity of the robot are improved by supplying feed while driving a portable small TMR with a capacity of 1–2 tons in the case of small farms. To this end, a robot that recognizes the environment in the livestock cowshed was developed by attaching a LiDAR and camera that can recognize the environment to the TMR feeding robot. In particular, it is composed of a system that can know the current location of the house by reading the tag installed in the house by installing the RFID inside the robot. Through RFID and tag information, the user can identify the robot's current location in the livestock barn and provide other types of feed to livestock for each cowshed. In the future, smart cattle farm will develop a system that systematically and conveniently manages the feeding, pathology, and environment of livestock by utilizing the 4th industrial revolution technology represented by technologies such as ICT, IoT, Robot, and AI. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

	abstract = {Cold stress in sheep is usually overlooked, even though the animals’ welfare and productivity are affected by low temperatures. The aim of this research was to find out if and to what extent the temperature inside a sheep barn could be maintained within the range of the thermoneutral zone during winter, primarily to increase feed conversion and to reduce GHG emissions. For this reason, an automation system was installed at a sheep barn in northern Greece, and heat losses from the building were calculated. The biogas potential of the sheep barn waste was examined in the laboratory via the BMP method. The results showed that the installation of an automation system together with a hypothetical biogas heating system could maintain the barn’s temperature in the range of a sheep’s thermoneutral zone during winter for the 94% of the scenarios examined if the total energy of the biogas was utilized, while heating energy that was instantly and continuously used succeeded in 48% of the investigated cases. The surplus of energy produced by biogas could potentially raise the water temperature that animals drink up to 2.9 °C. The absence of cold stress decreases the dry matter intake and the CH4 produced by ruminal fermentation. Moreover, lower GHG emissions are achieved as waste is treated through anaerobic digestion, which would likely be released into the environment if left untreated. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Precision livestock farming has a crucial function as farming grows in significance. It will help farmers make better decisions, alter their roles and perspectives as farmers and managers, and allow for the tracking and monitoring of product quality and animal welfare as mandated by the government and industry. Farmers can improve productivity, sustainability, and animal care by gaining a deeper understanding of their farm systems as a result of the increased use of data generated by smart farming equipment. Automation and robots in agriculture have the potential to play a significant role in helping society fulfill its future demands for food supply. These technologies have already enabled significant cost reductions in production, as well as reductions in the amount of intensive manual labor, improvements in product quality, and enhancements in environmental management. Wearable sensors can monitor eating, rumination, rumen pH, rumen temperature, body temperature, laying behavior, animal activity, and animal position or placement. Detachable or imprinted biosensors that are adaptable and enable remote data transfer might be highly important in this quickly growing industry. There are already multiple gadgets to evaluate illnesses such as ketosis or mastitis in cattle. The objective evaluation of sensor methods and systems employed on the farm is one of the difficulties presented by the implementation of modern technologies on dairy farms. The availability of sensors and high-precision technology for real-time monitoring of cattle raises the question of how to objectively evaluate the contribution of these technologies to the long-term viability of farms (productivity, health monitoring, welfare evaluation, and environmental effects). This review focuses on biosensing technologies that have the potential to change early illness diagnosis, management, and operations for livestock. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The rising economies of South America and Asia, which have also experienced an increase in the consumption of animal products, are substantially responsible for the increased nutritional needs of the world's population over the last four decades. As a result, the scale and management of animal production systems have significantly increased. Since grazing animals are frequently raised in herds, the producer's capacity to personally evaluate each animal is constrained by labor and financial constraints. Alive and Well Livestock The use of sensors and computer algorithms in real-time continuous monitoring and control systems for agriculture helps producers better understand the needs of individual animals while also spotting problems early. These include uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotic weighing scales, RFID sensors for tracking individual animals' behavior and body temperatures, virtual fencing for managing herds and grazing, robotic weighing scales, geographic information systems (GIS) for assessing and improving pastures, robotic weighing scales, and virtual weighing scales. Despite the availability of some commercial products, mainly for cattle, social, economic, and cultural constraints, as well as a dearth of suitable technological infrastructure, limit the adoption of these systems. In addition to providing recommendations for additional study and improvements to precision livestock farming (PLF) adoption and application in contemporary large-scale livestock systems, this paper outlines PLF systems and uses for grazing animals. © 2023 Veterinary Organization.

	abstract = {Pregnancy loss (PL) has important impacts on the profitability of livestock production systems, although it is not widely reported, particularly in Bos indicus cattle. The present study retrospectively evaluated PL after timed-artificial insemination (TAI) in Bos indicus (Nelore) beef cows corresponding to several factors, such as parity, body condition score (BCS), presence of corpus luteum (CL) at the beginning of TAI protocols, expression of estrus, and hormonal manipulations during the TAI protocol. Data from two experiments performed during three breeding seasons (BS) were reanalyzed. Both experiments evaluated adding GnRH treatment at TAI in a 7-d estradiol (E2) plus progesterone (P4)-based protocol, with intravaginal P4 implant removal on Day 7 combined with treatment with 0.5 or 1.0 mg E2 cypionate and 300 IU eCG, and TAI on Day 9. In addition, during BS 2 and 3 (Exp 2), cows were randomized to receive or not a PGF treatment on Day 0 (beginning of the TAI protocol). In all BS, presence of CL and BCS were evaluated at the beginning of TAI protocols, follicle size and expression of estrus were evaluated at TAI. The PL was assessed between the first pregnancy diagnosis (∼35d) and parturition. There were no effects of hormonal manipulations within TAI protocols of different BS on PL. There was no interaction between GnRH treatment at TAI and the other variables within BS, and there was no main effect of GnRH treatment on PL (without = 10.1% [102/1007] vs. with = 10.4% [114/1100]). The addition of PGF on Day 0 had no effect on PL (11.5% [102/886] vs. 10.5% [89/850]), as well as EC dose to induce final ovulation (10.8% [89/827] vs. 11.2% [102/909] for 0.5 and 1.0 mg, respectively). Primiparous had greater PL than multiparous cows (14.0% [77/550] vs. 8.9% [139/1557]), and cows not expressing estrus near TAI had greater PL than those expressing estrus (13.5% [57/422] vs. 9.7% [156/1617]). There was no interaction between follicle size at TAI and GnRH treatment on PL. However, probability of PL decreased linearly as follicle size at TAI increased. There were no effects of service number (first TAI or resynchronization), BCS, or presence of CL on D0 on PL. In addition, PL was not affected by sire within any of the BS. In conclusion, some factors that are known to impact pregnancy per AI also influenced PL, such as parity and expression of estrus, although, other aspects such as BCS, number of services, and presence of CL on D0 did not affect PL. Moreover, commonly implemented treatments to increase fertility (e.g., PGF on Day 0 and increasing EC dose to 1.0 mg) did not affect PL. Finally, the GnRH treatment at TAI had no effect on PL and did not interact with any of the variables, an important result, since GnRH at TAI also increases fertility in Bos indicus beef cows. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Automation is an important element in modern livestock farming. Image computer analysis is the automation technology aiming to monitor farm animals by recording continuous images. Further analysis can be carried out to assess more precisely and effectively farm animals’ welfare. The aim of this study was to determine the applicability of the commercial multi-sensor device (Peek Analytics) developed by Copeeks SAS (France), in comparison to human-based observations used to assess behaviors in pigs, including posture (standing/resting), area within the pen (feeding/drinking/resting/enrichment), and activity level (number of active pigs). Two Peek Analytics (Peek 3 and Peek 4) were installed on a commercial fattening pig farm in Murcia (Spain). Each device recorded data of two pens (39 pigs in four pens in total). Scan sampling was the human-based behavioral observation method used in this study. Data was collected for five consecutive days, in the following intervals: 09:00-11:00, 13:00-15:00, and 16:00-18:00 (30 hours of observation in total). Every pig was observed six times per hour and hence the information analyzed includes 7020 observations (180 observations/pig). The comparison between data from human observation and Peek Analytics was performed by using Pearson correlation tests. Posture, areas of interest, and activity level were analyzed separately, as well as data recorded by Peek 3 and 4. Results indicated that Peek Analytics showed a better agreement with human observation, when recording posture(r=0.77, P<0.01) and area within the pen (r=0.77, P<0.01), than when recording activity level (r=0.35, P<0.01). Two devices performed differently in general, with Peek 3 having better agreement than Peek 4 with human observation, regardless of posture, area within the pen, and activity level. The better agreement in Peek 3 may be attributed to the smaller number of pigs in Peek 3 (18) compared to Peek 4 (22). We can conclude from the study that image computer analysis may be reliable in assessing posture and area within the pen of pigs. On the other hand, a moderate agreement in activity level between human observation and computer vision can be due to different methodologies of recording the activity, rather than due to low accuracy of Peek Analytics.

	abstract = {The post-mortem inspection process of livestock viscera at abattoirs is expensive and laborious, but it is essential for the detection and condemnation of defective edible organs and carcases due to food safety issues. Lesions in hearts, kidneys, livers, lungs, and their associated lymph nodes are amongst the most common offal defects found in abattoirs. Visible (VIS) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging implemented in a multisensory platform were used to differentiate between sheep parenchymatous organs passed as fit (Healthy, n = 42) or not fit (Diseased, n = 47) for human consumption. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and random forest (RF) were used to classify organs as healthy or diseased in heart (n = 28), kidney (n = 15), liver (n = 24), and lung (n = 22). PLS-DA produced equal or greater classification accuracy and sensitivity than RF for all organs except for lung when the VIS sensor was used (means 84.4% and 78.3%, respectively). Livers and hearts (86.9%) showed higher accuracy than lungs and kidneys (75.9%). Limited differences occurred between VIS and SWIR sensors, although a single sensor tended to be more accurate than a combination of both. SWIR outperformed VIS in accuracy across all organs (84.8% vs. 76.3%), and the combination of VIS and SWIR was also accurate (83.0%). The use of hyperspectral imaging is an attractive proposition for the meat processing industry as a non-invasive imaging technology to detect defects in offal, and it can also provide automatic detection, saving time and labour costs. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Present networks (3G/4G), WiFi are in limited availability and bandwidth that cause delays in data transfer (latency) and hinder effective data transfer. But high-speed communication system, reliable and secured data connection is required for precision agriculture, cyber physical management systems and use of IoT in farm operations. Loss of data connection between devices, sensors or data servers’ impacts the precision and effectiveness of technology applied. High data transfer volumes and low latency data exchange were the major advantages of 5G technology, facilitates its use in precision farming and IoT applications in a most efficient way. It also enables the autonomous and robotic machinery for various operations in the aspects of agriculture and livestock production. The major application of 5G in mechanization is control systems for robotic harvesters, drones, autonomous vehicles, surveillance etc. Remote locations such as hill farms has the inherent constraints such as remoteness, marginality, slope etc., remains underutilized, can be developed with advanced communication systems. Even though there are several constraints in adoption of 5G technology, such as shortage in electricity supply, lower range coverage, the technology can ensure raise in agricultural production through mechanization.

	abstract = {Purpose: The automation of pork processing through robotics raises important societal concerns regarding working conditions of slaughterhouse workers and impacts on local communities. This article aims to evaluate the social performance and impacts of implementing an Autonomous Robotic System (ARS) for meat processing, comparing pre- and post-implementation scenarios. Methods: The methodology of Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) was applied to the European pork processing sector, focusing on stakeholder categories Workers and Local Community. These were assessed with nine social subcategories in total and 22 corresponding indicators, which were scored to assess the technology in question against a reference scale where each score level has clearly established criteria. The data collection strategy combined a survey, individual interviews, and focus group interviews as well as secondary data collected from desktop research and database data. Results and discussion: The results suggest a considerable improvement in social performance and impacts when moving from the conventional meat processing scenario to the ARS. All subcategories from both stakeholder categories scored higher in the post-ARS scenario. The most improved social subcategories were Health and safety and Access to immaterial resources. A considerable improvement was identified in social subcategories Working hours, Freedom of association and collective bargaining, and Fair salary. A modest improvement was identified in social subcategories Equal opportunities and discrimination, Employment relationship, and Migration and delocalisation. The ARS is anticipated to mitigate injury risks that workers are exposed to in a conventional meat factory and to reduce sick leave but will also necessitate training and close collaboration between unions and management teams. Conclusions: Using a reference scale approach, we identified an improvement of the social performance in the pork processing industry post-ARS implementation, both for Workers and Local community. It is important to pay attention to social impacts and performances when introducing new technology such as automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence to ensure that these do not have unintended social impacts and/or poor social performance.

	abstract = {In this paper an autonomous system to detect and combat Rumex obtusifolius leveraging autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), small autonomous sprayer robots and 5G SA connectivity is presented. Rumex obtusifolius is a plant found on grassland that drains nutrients from surrounding plants and has lower nutritive value than the surrounding grass. High concentrations of it have to be combated in order to use the grass as feed for livestock. One or more UAV are controlled through 5G to survey the current working area and send back high-definition photos of the ground to an edge cloud server. There an AI algorithm using neural networks detects the Rumex obtusifolius and calculates its position using the UAVs position data. When plants are detected an optimal path is calculated and sent via 5G to the sprayer robot to get to them in minimal time. It will then move to the position of the broad-leafed dock and use an on-board camera and the edge cloud to verify the position of the plant and precisely spray crop protection only where the target plant is. The spraying robot and UAV are already operational, the training of the detection algorithm is still ongoing. The described system is being tested with a fixed private 5G SA network and a nomadic 5G SA network as public cellular networks are not performant enough in regards to low latency and upload bandwidth. © 2023 Mobilkommunikation: Technologien und Anwendungen - 27.

	abstract = {Thoroughly analyzing the sperm and exploring the information obtained using artificial intelligence (AI) could be the key to improving fertility estimation. Artificial neural networks have already been applied to calculate zootechnical indices in animals and predict fertility in humans. This method of estimating the results of reproductive biotechnologies, such as in vitro embryo production (IVEP) in cattle, could be valuable for livestock production. This study was developed to model IVEP estimates in Senepol animals based on various sperm attributes, through retrospective data from 290 IVEP routines performed using 38 commercial doses of semen from Senepol bulls. All sperm samples that had undergone the same procedure during sperm selection for in vitro fertilization were evaluated using a computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system to define sperm subpopulations. Sperm morphology was also analyzed in a wet preparation, and the integrity of the plasma and acrosomal membranes, mitochondrial potential, oxidative status, and chromatin resistance were evaluated using flow cytometry. A previous study identified three sperm subpopulations in such samples and the information used in tandem with other sperm quality variables to perform an AI analysis. AI analysis generated models that estimated IVEP based on the season, donor, percentage of viable oocytes, and 18 other sperm predictor variables. The accuracy of the results obtained for the three best AI models for predicting the IVEP was 90.7, 75.3, and 79.6%, respectively. Therefore, applying this AI technique would enable the estimation of high or low embryo production for individual bulls based on the sperm analysis information.

	abstract = {Sensor-enabled big data and artificial intelligence platforms have the potential to address global socio-economic trends related to the livestock production sector through advances in the digitization of precision livestock farming. The increased interest in animal welfare, the likely reduction in the number of animals in relation to population growth in the coming decade and the growing demand for animal proteins pose an acute challenge to prioritizing animal welfare on the one hand, while maximizing the efficiency of production systems on the other. Current digital approaches do not meet these challenges due to a lack of efficient and lack of real-time non-invasive precision measurement technologies that can detect and monitor animal diseases and identify resilience in animals. In this opinion review paper, I offer a critical view of the potential of wearable sensor technologies as a unique and necessary contribution to the global market for farm animal health monitoring. To stimulate the sustainable, digital and resilient recovery of the agricultural and livestock industrial sector, there is an urgent need for testing and developing new ideas and products such as wearable sensors. By validating and demonstrating a fully functional wearable sensor prototype within an operational environment on the livestock farm that includes a miniaturized animal-borne biosensor and an artificial intelligence (AI)-based data acquisition and processing platform, the current needs, which have not yet been met, can be fulfilled. The expected quantifiable results from wearable biosensors will demonstrate that the digitization technology can perform acceptably within the performance parameters specified by the agricultural sector and under operational conditions, to measurably improve livestock productivity and health. The successful implementation of the digital wearable sensor networks would provide actionable real-time information on animal health status and can be deployed directly on the livestock farm, which will strengthen the green and digital recovery of the economy due to its significant and innovative potential. © 2023 by the author.},

Cows (B. taurus) and horses (E. caballus) were introduced in pasture to a robot controlled either manually via teleoperation and autonomously via a costmap-based navigation algorithm. The robot maneuver at random, simulating a manure collection task, until all animals in the pasture lost vigilant attention to the robot. The time of initial loss of interest, interest over time, and time of ultimate loss of interest (10 consecutive seconds of non-vigilance) were recorded. The pasture sanitation robot was successful in manual and autonomous navigation of pastures. The robot was able to operate autonomously in pasture safely without changing qualitative response from the animals, as compared to manual methods. The deployment of autonomous control did not increase stress as a function of vigilance as compared to manual teleoperation. Both methods contribute to the development and evaluation of future pasture sanitation robots. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI) is among the most effective reproductive biotechnologies that afford widespread propagation of genes carried by superior males. A cross-sectional study followed by a simple random sampling technique was conducted from December 2021 to May 2022 to assess the constraints of artificial insemination (AI) provision in and around Kacha Bira district, Southern Ethiopia, using a structured questionnaire. A total of 200 respondents were surveyed accordingly. In this study, the education level of farmers revealed no statistically significant difference P>0.05 with the identification of time of insemination. Conception failure (62.5%), unavailability of artificial insemination technicians (7.5%), dystocia (3.5%), and both conception failure and unavailability of artificial insemination technicians (4.5%) were found to be the major constraints of AI service in the study area according to dairy cattle owners' response and revealed a statistically significant difference P<0.05 with AI service. Although statistically significant P<0.05, differences in AI service interruptions during both regular working hours and weekends and holidays were also observed. Among total respondents, 20.5% of dairy cattle owners got AI service at right time, but 79.5% of them used it at the wrong time. Regarding inbreeding problems, 77.5% of dairy cattle owners responded that there was no inbreeding problem and the remaining 22.5% of farmers indicated presence of inbreeding problem of which 10.5% and 10% had a perception that local breeds had low milk production and low genetic improvement than exotic breeds, respectively. On the other hand, 11.5% of dairy cattle owners responded that local breeds have a similar level of disease resistance to that of exotic breeds (11%). 48.5% of dairy farmers reported that bellowing is the most frequent sign that they used to detect heat followed by vulval discharge (23%) and mounting on other cows (10%). Majority (78.5%) of the dairy cattle owners interviewed were found to be not satisfied with the artificial insemination services. In general, different AI technicians and cattle and dairy cattle keeper-related factors constrain the AI service and its result in survey site. Therefore, smallholder dairy cattle owners should be trained sufficiently about the AI service strategies, usage, and proper management of dairy farms and the technical constraints should be avoided in order to provide AI service sufficiently.  © 2023 Mesfin Mathewos et al.},

	abstract = {Giardia duodenalis is a protozoan parasite that infects humans, companion animals, livestock, and wildlife. Infections in cattle caused by this parasite are often asymptomatic, but such infections can cause diarrhea, reduced weight gain, and ill-thrift in young calves. Although G. duodenalis causes diarrhea in calves, only a few studies have been conducted on calves in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Here, we aimed to determine the prevalence and distribution of G. duodenalis assemblages in pre-weaned calves with diarrhea in the ROK, identify the association between the occurrence of G. duodenalis and the age of calf, and perform molecular characterization of G. duodenalis. We collected 455 fecal samples from pre-weaned native Korean calves (≤60 days old) with diarrhea in four different regions. G. duodenalis was detected using nested PCR targeting the beta-giardin (bg) gene, and positive samples were further genotyped for the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) genes. The overall prevalence of G. duodenalis in calves with diarrhea was 4.4% (20/455) based on the analysis of bg. The highest prevalence was observed in calves aged 11-30 days (7.5%; 95% confidence interval: 3.7%-11.3%), whereas the lowest prevalence was observed in neonatal calves. From the 20 samples that were positive for bg, 16, 5, and 6 sequences were obtained following genotyping of bg, gdh, and tpi, respectively. Sequencing analysis of the bg gene revealed the presence of assemblage E (n = 15) and sub-assemblage AI (n = 1) in the samples. Moreover, we detected mixed infections with assemblages E and A in two calves for the first time. Among the sequences obtained herein, two new subtypes of assemblage E were detected in gdh and tpi sequences each. The results suggest that G. duodenalis is an infectious agent causing diarrhea in calves, and pre-weaned calves are at a higher risk of infection than neonatal calves. Multilocus genotyping should be performed to confirm the presence of potentially zoonotic genotypes. These results highlight the importance of cattle as a source of zoonotic transmission of G. duodenalis to humans.  © 2023 Park et al.

	abstract = {The agricultural industry is facing unprecedented challenges in meeting the growing demand for food while minimizing its impact on the environment. To address these challenges, the industry is embracing technological advancements such as 5G networks to improve efficiency and productivity. However, the benefits of 5G technology must be weighed against the costs of implementing a suitable network. This paper presents cost-benefit dimensions that are needed to assess the economic feasibility of implementing 5G networks for several agricultural applications. The paper describes the costs of deploying and maintaining a 5G network and the benefits of several 5G-specific use cases, including precision agriculture, livestock monitoring, and swarm robotics. Using industry reports and case studies, the model quantifies the benefits of 5G networks, such as enabling new digital agricultural processes, increased productivity, and improved sustainability. It also considers the costs associated with equipment and infrastructure, as well as the challenges of deploying a network in rural areas. The results demonstrate that 5G networks can provide significant benefits to agricultural businesses and provide an overview about the cost factors. Both benefit and cost dimensions are analyzed for the 5G-specific agricultural use cases. © 2023, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

	abstract = {Agriculture is the process of growing crops and raising livestock and cultivating other forms of food. It has been a fundamental activity for human societies throughout history, providing food and other resources necessary for survival. Hence plant diseases can have a significant impact on the economy, particularly in agricultural-dependent countries. Crop yield loss, trade restrictions, increased production costs and reduced agricultural productivity are some of the ways plant diseases can affect the economy. Farmers visually inspect their crops for symptoms of diseases, such as discoloration, spots, wilting, and deformities. Farmers can also use their sense of touch and smell to detect diseases, such as the sticky or slimy feel of plant leaves infected with fungal diseases and the foul smell of rotting or decaying plant material. However, traditional methods of plant disease detection do have limitations. Visual inspection and other traditional methods may not always detect diseases at an early stage, and there is a risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, conventional techniques may fail to identify illnesses that are not perceptible to the unaided observation. The other alternatives are the use of Artificial Intelligence(AI) which includes training computers to detect plant diseases using image recognition technology. These AI methods are increasingly being used for plant disease detection because they offer a fast, accurate, and cost-effective way to diagnose plant diseases, which can help prevent crop losses and increase yields. In this article, a Multilayer CNN model, inspired by InceptionNet, is put forward. This model is trained on the "Plant Pathology 2021: FGVC8 dataset". This proposed model is compared with three existing CNN models using RMSprop with Nesterov Momentum Optimizer. The suggested model outperforms other models that are already trained and achieves an accuracy of 92.56% in diagnosing the disease.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a smart surveillance system using robotics for analysing the wellbeing of the livestock and early detection of disease in poultry farms. The current system often identifies infections too late, resulting in mass culling of flocks. The proposed solution is to use disease control through vaccination as an alternate approach. The proof of concept for this paper was implemented using the Raspberry Pi 4 along with Arduino UNOs, which was adapted to better suit the needs of the paper. The system was able to collect data from sensors measuring variables such as Ammonia, Carbon Dioxide, temperature, and humidity. The wellbeing of the chicken can be monitored through the environmental variables being sensed. Based on studies, deviations in these variables from the baseline can indicate the presence of disease. Some systems also listen to sounds to understand if illnesses are prevalent. The data will be passed through a series of conditions to determine the probability of infection within the farm. Experimental analyses through simulations were conducted with the mobile robot connected with sensors. Based on the significant deviation of sensor outputs from the benchmark values, the presence of disease in the livestock was detected in the early stages. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The goal of the current study is to identify the effect of life cycle inventory (LCI) specifications on carbon footprint of feed used to produce one kg of broiler meat in multi-treatment trials. A total of 384 one-day Hubbard JA787 male checks were allocated equally to 48 pens. The pens were distributed randomly to three treatments (16 pens/treatment), high density (crude protein (ME): 23% (12.5 MJ/kg),20.4% (13 MJ/kg), 19.1% (13.7 MJ/kg) for starter grower and finisher diets, respectively), medium density (crude protein (ME): 22.3% (12.2 MJ/kg), 19.7 (12.6 MJ/kg),18.2% (13 MJ/kg) for starter grower and finisher diets, respectively) and low density (crude protein (ME): 21.6% (11.9 MJ/kg), 19 (12.1 MJ/kg),17.3% (12.4 MJ/kg) for starter grower and finisher diets, respectively). The experimental birds had free access to water and feed throughout the trial. All experimental diets were in crumb form in starter phase and in pellet form in grower and finisher phase. Two birds/pen were euthanised at the end of the trial (day 42) to obtain meat yield. Feed consumption and bird weight of each pen were recorded weekly. The carbon footprint (CF) of feed consumed by each pen was calculated and normalised for one kg meat yield. The CF of the pens was calculated using 3 open access databases (Agribalyse (ReCiPe (H) impact assessment method and mass allocation), GLFI (ReCiPe 2016 midpoint (H), mass allocation) and ECO-ALIM (CLM impact assessment method and mass allocation). The three CF datasets were combined and analysed to determine the effect of treatment, LCI database and treatment*LCI database on CF of broilers. The CF of each pen was calculated using GLFI database according to three allocation methods, mass, energy and economic. Data of the three allocation methods were combined and analysed to identify the effect of treatment, allocation method and treatment*allocation method on CF. Agribalyse dataset was used to calculated CF of each pen according to 3 impact assessment methods, ReCiPe (i), IPCC 2013 and CLM (with AI as a baseline). The three datasets were combined and analysed to determine the effect of the treatment, impact assessment method of LCA and treatment*assessment method on CF. There was significant effect of treatment, database and treatment*database on CF (P < 0.001). The CF was significantly affected by treatment, impact assessment method and the treatment*impact assessment method (P = 0.037). Treatment and treatment*allocation method significantly affected the CF (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the effect of the dietary treatment on CF depends on the LCI database, impact assessment method and method of allocation. Thus, LCI specifications should be presented in detail in broiler trials aiming at identifying of the effect dietary treatment on CF of broilers. © 2022},

	abstract = {Low conception rate, long calving interval, and poor calf production limits the profitability of livestock production keeping food security a concern. In the ASEAN region, artificial insemination (AI) remains the most common reproductive biotechnology used for livestock breeding to produce up-graded and genetically superior animals that could address the need for food and income to the rural farming communities. Field technicians play a crucial role in carrying out AI to enhance reproduction especially in the remote areas. While ultrasonography emerged as an efficient tool to check the reproductive organ of animals for efficient reproduction, the cost of the machine hinders its availability and access by Field technicians. Skills on palpation per rectum of the ovarian dynamics and tonicity of the uterus are important assets. This paper discusses the importance of Female Reproductive Organ Monitoring or FROM in the economical and efficient application of AI in the field and enhance livestock reproduction. Strategies to develop the skills of AI practitioners are outlined to come out to skilled technicians who could execute an accurately check the reproductive status of the animals and determine the perfect time to carry out an effective and efficient AI. This method is helpful in determining the timing of AI making the resources, time and efforts of the technicians maximized and livestock production more efficient.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The effect of humanity on the earth becomes more and more apparent. Besides the publicly discussed climate change and overpopulation, also the number of conflicts with wildlife increases. The technological progress of the past years helped to understand these challenges better. Monitoring solutions, known to the public as the Internet of Things (IoT), increase the amount of collected data, whereas artificial intelligence (AI) supports analyzing and gathering a deeper understanding. Most projects in the area of wildlife try to achieve a more sustainable usage of natural resources and a better coexistence with our environment. The mAInZaun project focuses on the conflict between wolves and livestock. It aims to introduce these new technologies into grazing management and foster non-lethally coexistence between livestock and predators. Artificial intelligence (AI) analyzes images and videos of the areas surrounding the pasture. The algorithms detect possible attackers or predators, such as wolves, stray dogs, bobcats, etc. In the second step, these animals are scared away using adaptive technologies. These can be sound, ultrasound, scent, light, etc. These systems are usually operated in remote environments, raising challenges like hardware design, power requirements, and maintenance. This paper will discuss these challenges and how we address them in the mAInZaun project. © 2023 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Gorai River is a significant river in Bangladesh’s southwestern region, where residents make great use of the water despite a lack of adequate and reliable information concerning water quality and pollution levels. Thus, the goal of this research was to examine the spatio-temporal variations in water quality and determine whether it was suitable for drinking, agriculture, industrial, or livestock purposes, as well as the influencing factors and potential sources of water pollution. Surface water samples were collected in wet and dry seasons from ten sampling sites, and twenty water quality parameters were evaluated. The results showed that some studied water quality parameters, e.g., temperature, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, and nitrate, exceeded the maximum allowable limit. Water quality index values exhibited that the water quality of all sampling sites was found to be poor to very poor during the wet season, while only St-4 and St-5 were found to be poor and the rest of the investigated sites were good category during the dry season. Based on sodium adsorption ratio, soluble sodium percentage, residual sodium carbonate, residual sodium bicarbonate, and permeability index values, it was depicted that river water was suitable for irrigation purposes, but when compared to Kelly’s ratio (KR) and magnesium hazard ratio values, river water was found to be unfit for irrigation. Moreover, potential salinity (PS) and sodium-to-calcium activity ratio (SCAR) values allow the water as moderately suitable for use in irrigation purposes. Langelier saturation index (LSI) and aggressive index (AI) values revealed that the river water was under saturated to supersaturated and moderate to non-aggressive in nature. However, Ryznar stability index (RSI), Puckorius scaling index (PSI), and Larson–Skold index (LS) values describe whether the water was high or severely corrosive, signifying its inappropriateness for industrial consumption. Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis depicted that the fluctuations in water quality are mostly related to point and non-point contaminations, such as urban and industrial effluent discharged and agricultural runoff of fertilizers. Cluster analysis (CA) revealed relative geographical and seasonal changes in water quality, showing the impact of hydrological changes and contamination. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a literature review and interview study exploring the opportunities and hurdles when implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agricultural businesses. Three sectors in agriculture are scrutinized: arable farming, milk production and beef production. As a foundation for the project, a literature review revises former research on smart farming. Thereafter, an interview study with 21 respondents both explores the susceptibility and maturity of smart farming technologies and provides technical depth to three chosen applications of AI in agriculture. Although the focus of the study is on the Swedish context, the findings can be generalized to the European agricultural sector and even world-wide. Findings of the study include a diverse set of aspects that both enable and obstruct the transition. Main identified opportunities are the importance smart farming has on the strategic agendas of several industry stakeholders, the general trend towards software technology as a service through shared machinery, the vast amount of existing data, and the large interest from farmers towards new technology. Contrasting, the study identifies main hurdles as technical and legislative challenges to data ownership, potential cybersecurity threats, the need for a well-articulated business case, and the sometimes lacking technical knowledge within the sector. The paper concludes that the macro trend points towards a smart farming transition but that the speed of the transformation will depend on the resolutions for the identified obstacles. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Introduction: sporadic outbreak of avian influenza (AI) is still being reported in Nigeria, albeit with increased disease incidence amongst intensive commercial poultry flocks. The purpose of this study was to conduct a rapid risk assessment (RRA) to determine the risk factors that may be associated with the introduction and spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry farms within Ebonyi State, Nigeria. Methods: this study was conducted from 18th to 25th January 2022. A rapid risk assessment team (RRA) was constituted, (Federal and State epidemiology officers, regional disease investigation surveillance system evaluation veterinary officers, and avian influenza (AI) desk officers in the 3 senatorial zones of the state). We reviewed the poultry disease line list obtained from the Epidemiology Unit of the Federal Department of Veterinary Services, Ebonyi State, Nigeria. We purposively identified poultry farms with a high incidence of suspected cases of Newcastle diseases (NCD) and confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and conducted a RRA for the outbreak of HPAI based on the technical guidelines of the Food and agricultural organisation (FAO), rapid risk assessment for animal health threat. We defined RRA triage with an indicator score (yes) ≥ 50, defined the hazard profile of HPAI, develop risk questions for RRA, plotted the scenario tree for the introduction of HPAI into poultry farms and determined the risk of an outbreak of AI in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. Additional information was obtained by the administration of a structured questionnaire, which accessed sources of poultry, poultry husbandry, biosecurity measures, and management of poultry flocks. Results: in all, we accessed 17 poultry farms in the three senatorial zones of Ebonyi State, the proportion of livestock kept were swine and poultry chicken, 4 (24%), ducks, poultry chicken, 2 (12%), swine, ducks, poultry chicken (6%), poultry chicken alone 10 (59%), 16 (96%) of poultry farmers obtained their poultry flock from plateau, Oyo, and Nasarawa State, Nigeria. Availability foots deep on farms are, 4 (24%), none of the farms visited has an isolation pen. In an event of an outbreak of AI 15 million poultry chicken may be at risk in the study area. Conclusion: there is a high risk for the outbreak of AI in poultry farms accessed during the study period. An outbreak of AI may occur through the movement of apparently healthy poultry flocks by middlemen from states with confirmed outbreaks to Ebonyi State, the non-availability of biosecurity structures on the farms may ensure spread of infection within and between contiguous poultry units. Similarly, sales of poultry waste to crop farmers who use them as animal manures may contribute to the spread of HPAI, local chickens, wild birds, swine which scavenge on these poultry waste may contribute to the emergence of reassortant influenza strains with no prior human or animal immunity. © Okoli Solomon Chieloka et al.},

	abstract = {The field of animal science, and especially animal nutrition, relies heavily on modeling to accomplish its day-To-day objectives. New data streams ("big data") and the exponential increase in computing power have allowed the appearance of "new"modeling methodologies, under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI). However, many of these modeling methodologies have been around for decades. According to Gartner, technological innovation follows five distinct phases: Technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. The appearance of AI certainly elicited much hype within agriculture leading to overpromised plug-And-play solutions in a field heavily dependent on custom solutions. The threat of failure can become real when advertising a disruptive innovation as sustainable. This does not mean that we need to abandon AI models. What is most necessary is to demystify the field and place a lesser emphasis on the technology and more on business application. As AI becomes increasingly more powerful and applications start to diverge, new research fields are introduced, and opportunities arise to combine "old"and "new"modeling technologies into hybrids. However, sustainable application is still many years away, and companies and universities alike do well to remain at the forefront. This requires investment in hardware, software, and analytical talent. It also requires a strong connection to the outside world to test, that which does, and does not work in practice and a close view of when the field of agriculture is ready to take its next big steps. Other research fields, such as engineering and automotive, have shown that the application power of AI can be far reaching but only if a realistic view of models as whole is maintained. In this review, we share our view on the current and future limitations of modeling and potential next steps for modelers in the animal sciences. First, we discuss the inherent dependencies and limitations of modeling as a human process. Then, we highlight how models, fueled by AI, can play an enhanced sustainable role in the animal sciences ecosystem. Lastly, we provide recommendations for future animal scientists on how to support themselves, the farmers, and their field, considering the opportunities and challenges the technological innovation brings.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {Accurate objective, automated limb lameness detection and pose estimation play an important role for animal well-being and precision livestock farming. We present a wearable sensor-based limb lameness detection and pose estimation for horse walk and trot locomotion. The gait event and lameness detection are first built on a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. Its outcomes are used in the limb pose estimation. A learned low-dimensional motion manifold is parameterized by a phase variable with a Gaussian process dynamic model. We compare the RNN-LSTM-based lameness detection method with a feature-based multi-layer classifier (MLC) and a multi-class classifier (MCC) that are built on support vector machine/K-nearest-neighbors and deep convolutional neural network methods, respectively. Experimental results show that using only accelerometer measurements, the RNN-LSTM-based approach achieves 95% lameness detection accuracy and also outperforms the feature-based MLC or MCC in terms of several assessment criteria. The pose estimation scheme can predict the 24 limb joint angles in the sagittal plane with average errors less than 5 and 10 degs under normal and induced lameness conditions, respectively. The presented work demonstrate the successful use of machine learning techniques for high performance lameness detection and pose estimation in equine science. Note to Practitioners - Automation technologies are increasingly used for precision agriculture but few have focused on monitoring individual animals in open field for precision livestock farming. Limb lameness detection and pose estimation in open field is labor-intensive, unsafe for farmers, and inefficient. The presented machine learning-enabled, wearable inertial sensor-based design provides an effective and efficient approach for horse limb lameness detection and pose estimation applications. We present an RNN-LSTM for lameness detection and an integrated manifold learning model is used to predict the horse limb joint angles in walk and trot gaits under normal and induced lameness conditions. We also present a systematic analysis and experiments to demonstrate the impacts of the wearable sensor locations and signal information on lameness detection and pose estimation performance. Several other machine learning-based lameness detection methods are also presented and compared. The extensive multi-horse testing results are presented to demonstrate the superior accuracy and higher performance than other types of machine learning methods. One attractive feature of the proposed design lies in its high performance and fast computational capability for potential real-time applications in open field.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hematophagous flies are a pest for livestock; their direct impact reduces productivity, and they are vectors of parasites, bacteria and viruses. Their control using insecticides is inefficient and highly polluting. The validation of new control tools requires efficacy and cost-effectiveness evaluation. The quantification of hematophagous insects’ impact in livestock is a challenging prerequisite. Tail flicks counts can reliably evaluate fly-burden; however, visual records are tedious and time-consuming. In the present study, automation of tail flick counts was made through the use of pedometers attached to the tail, in two groups of feeder cattle. Group A was kept in a pen under the protection of a mosquito net, and Group B was kept in an open-air pen. The fly density of Group B was evaluated using fly traps. The apparent density per trap ranged from 130 to 1700 in the study. The mean pedometer records per 24 h ranged from 957+/−58 bits in Group A to 11,138+/−705 bits in Group B. The night/day records observed in Group A (200/800 bits) were drastically increased in Group B (1000–4000/4000–14,000 bits) and variable along seasons. A very high correlation was observed between fly density and visual records or pedometer records (PR). Two-hour PRs proved to be a reliable predictive tool for fly density. Moreover, the pedometers revealed an unsuspected but significant nuisance of mosquitoes, which should be thoroughly investigated. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The size of the pork market is increasing globally to meet the demand for animal protein, resulting in greater farm size for swine and creating a great challenge to swine farmers and industry owners in monitoring the farm activities and the health and behavior of the herd of swine. In addi-tion, the growth of swine production is resulting in a changing climate pattern along with the envi-ronment, animal welfare, and human health issues, such as antimicrobial resistance, zoonosis, etc. The profit of swine farms depends on the optimum growth and good health of swine, while modern farming practices can ensure healthy swine production. To solve these issues, a future strategy should be considered with information and communication technology (ICT)‐based smart swine farming, considering auto‐identification, remote monitoring, feeding behavior, animal rights/wel-fare, zoonotic diseases, nutrition and food quality, labor management, farm operations, etc., with a view to improving meat production from the swine industry. Presently, swine farming is not only focused on the development of infrastructure but is also occupied with the application of techno-logical knowledge for designing feeding programs, monitoring health and welfare, and the repro-duction of the herd. ICT‐based smart technologies, including smart ear tags, smart sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), deep learning, big data, and robotics systems, can take part directly in the operation of farm activities, and have been proven to be effective tools for collecting, processing, and analyzing data from farms. In this review, which considers the beneficial role of smart technologies in swine farming, we suggest that smart technologies should be applied in the swine industry. Thus, the future swine industry should be automated, considering sustainability and productivity. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: There are high hopes that digital tools can reduce constraints to livestock development, which in turn promises to alleviate poverty, improve food and nutrition security, and reduce environmental footprints. Yet, little systematic evidence exists on the state of digital livestock in low- and middle-income-countries. Thus, it remains unclear whether such high hopes are justified. OBJECTIVE: Focusing on India and Kenya, we aim to better understand, among others, the degree of technological sophistication of the digital tools used, the types of value chains and constraints addressed, the types of business models pursued, and more broadly the opportunities and challenges of digital tools for agricultural development. METHOD: We combine a review of digital tools in India and Kenya with three “on-the-ground” case studies: Herdman, a tool for Indian dairy organizations working with small-scale livestock keepers, facilitating data collection and supervision of field agents; Farmtree, a tool supporting medium-scale livestock keepers in India to manage their herds, and iCow, an e-extension tool for farmers in Kenya. For the review, we develop a conceptual framework that distinguishes different types of tools: 1) “simple digital tools”, providing generic information, 2) “smart digital tools”, providing tailored information based on data entered by livestock keepers, 3) “smart digital tools”, using data from sensors, 4) “digital tools for value chains”, enabling the integration of value chain actors, 5) “automated digital systems”, which are coupled with robots, allowing for automation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Digital tools provide many new options to address constraints to livestock development. So far, most tools are “simple digital tools”, followed by “smart digital tools” using manual data and tools for value chains. Such tools that only require smartphone ownership are the “sweet spot” for supporting digital livestock development; however, even embodied “smart digital tools” using sensors can be of relevance for small-scale livestock keepers with appropriate organizational models. Most digital tools focus on dairy production, suggesting neglect of other types of livestock, and there are few tools for pastoralists. SIGNIFICANCE: The conceptual framework as well as many of the lessons learned are of relevance to understanding the contribution of digital tools to livestock development - and agricultural development more broadly - in low- and middle-income-countries. While digital tools are no silver bullets – and come with some new challenges such as data security and sovereignty concerns - they are likely to become a key pillar of agricultural and livestock development in the near future. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Pasture is a said to be a natural feed to the animal. Pastures are maintained to ensure a good quality and quantity of the feed to get the best produce from the animals. Traditional ways of managing the pastures are costly and labor intensive. The use of technology in farming introduced the concept of smart farming which made pasture management easier and cost effective. Smart farming integrates advanced technological methods that include Internet of Things (IoT), big data and cloud computing. These enable tracking, monitoring, automating and complex operational analysis operations. However even with the use of these new technological techniques there are still challenges facing pasture management. Pastures are dependent on climatic conditions therefore climate change has a great impact on pasture management. With the onset of climate change, it has become a challenge for livestock farmers to predict weather conditions therefore it is impossible for decision makers to deal more effectively with the effects of climate variability. However, the digital twin concept proved to be the best technique to tackle these challenges due to its complex prediction techniques that include artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. This paper analyses the models used in building a digital shadow as the first step in developing a digital twin. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The growth rate and feed consumption of piglets are significant indicators for the health of the animal and are of economic importance in pig production. New approaches, such as continuous automated real-time monitoring of animal behaviour and health, aim to meet the increasing requirements in pig production on productivity, profitability as well as animal health and welfare. The Asserva System PigInsight is unique for automated feeding and weighing of small piglets at weaning age. Using RFID (radio-frequency identification) ear chips, the system permits individual recognition and monitoring of daily feed consumption and body weight for each animal without causing any stress and extra labour. The aim of this study was to compare individual data recorded by the system with traditional pen-based feed consumption and manual individual weighing of the animals on 6 occasions over a 7-week trial period. Therefore, 84 healthy weaned piglets were allocated to 6 slatted floor pens with balanced mean body weight, sex ratio, age and relatedness among pens. All animals were fitted with RFID ear-tags. Feed (ad libitum, 12 g per demand) and water (ad libitum) were provided through two automated feeders and drinkers per pen. We verified that the system estimated body weight reliably (R2 = 0.986). During our verification period, a mean deviation of 0.2633 kg +/- SE 0.1609 (n = 6 weighing occasions) between manual and automated weighing was recorded. The individually monitoring of body weight and feed consumption can be further developed for an early and automated detection of animal health issues. © ECPLF 2022. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Poultry production utilizes many available technologies in terms of farm-industry automation and sanitary control. However, there is a lack of robust techniques and affordable equipment for avian embryo detection and sexual segregation at the early stages. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the potential use of thermal micro cameras for detecting embryos in quail eggs via thermal images during the first 168 h (7 days) of incubation. We propose a methodology to collect data during the incubation period. Additionally, to support the visual analysis, YOLO deep learning object detection algorithms were applied to detect unfertilized eggs; the results showed its potential to distinguish fertilized eggs from unfertilized eggs during the incubation period, after filtering radiometric images. We compared YOLOv4, YOLOv5 and SSD-MobileNet V2 trained models. The mAP@0.50 of the YOLOv4, YOLOv5 and SSD-MobileNet V2 was 98.62%, 99.5% and 91.8%, respectively. We also compared three testing datasets for different intervals of rotation of eggs, as our hypothesis was that fewer turning periods could improve the visualization of fertilized egg features, and applied three treatments: 1.5 h, 6 h, and 12 h. The results showed that turning eggs in different periods did not exhibit a linear relation, as the F1 Score for YOLOv4 of detection for the 12 h period was 0.569, that for the 6 h period was 0.404 and that for the 1.5 h period was 0.384. YOLOv5 F1 Scores for 12 h, 6 h and 1.5 h were 1, 0.545 and 0.386, respectively. SSD-MobileNet V2 performed F1 scores of 0.60 for 12 h, 0.22 for 6 h and 0 for 1.5 h turning periods. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of GnRH administrated at day 35 after artificial insemination (AI) on the reproductive performance of buffalo cows. In ten buffalo farms in the period January–February, 481 buffalo cows were subjected to estrus synchronization protocol and fixed-time artificial insemination (Ovsynch–TAI program). Radioimmunoassays (RIA) for pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) were used to detect pregnancy at day 28 after AI (cut-off value: ≥1 ng/mL). Among pregnant subjects, those with PAG values between 1 and 2.5 ng/mL were considered at risk of embryonic mortality (EM) and were assigned into two groups: treated (T; n = 57) control (C; n = 57). Treated buffaloes received 0.01 mg of buserelin acetate intramuscularly on day 35 after AI, whereas control buffaloes received no treatment. The pregnancy diagnosis was confirmed at day 60 through PAGs level and rectal palpation. The treatment with GnRH had a significant effect (p < 0.001) in reducing EM. Between days 28 and 60 after AI, the animals that experienced EM were only 2/57 in the T group, while were 13/57 in the C group. Moreover, GnRH treatment produced a significant increase (p < 0.001) in the PAG concentration between day 28 and day 60.

	abstract = {Chinese consumers often prefer to buy live chickens for cooking at home rather than chilled or frozen chicken meat because of the superior flavor. Even though the purchase of live chickens for consumption was restricted by the Chinese government after the avian influenza (AI) virus outbreak in 2013, people continue to buy live chickens. Thus, it is important to understand why people make this decision. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships among chicken meat taste preferences, perceived risk of human infection with AI virus, and chicken meat consumption behaviors in China. To address this, a survey of 1108 individuals was carried out in Jiangsu Province. This province was selected because its per capita consumption of poultry products is higher than the national average, and it is at the highest risk for avian influenza A H7N9 and H5N1 virus epidemics out of all provinces in China. Descriptive statistics, multivariate linear regression, and hierarchical regression modeling were used to analyze the data. The results showed that Chinese consumers still buy live chickens at a high rate due to taste preferences, and have a very low perceived risk of infection with AI virus. Multivariate linear and hierarchical regression analyses showed that total monthly household income was significantly and positively associated with the perceived importance of chicken taste; the number of people in the household and the perceived importance of chicken taste were significantly and positively associated with the purchase of live chickens for consumption; age was significantly and negatively associated with the purchase of chilled and frozen chicken for consumption; and education and expertize in livestock-related fields were significantly and positively associated with the purchase of live chickens for consumption. Expertize in livestock-related fields was significantly and positively associated with perceived risk of human infection with AI virus, and perceived risk was significantly and positively associated with the purchase of chilled chicken for consumption. However, the perceived risk of human infection with AI virus had no effect on the relationship between the perceived importance of chicken taste and the purchase of live chickens for consumption. The findings from this study suggest that, over time and with increasing public education, the purchase of live poultry for consumption will gradually decline in China. However, to accelerate this process, measures should be taken to reduce consumer perception of taste differences between chilled chicken meat and meat from freshly killed chickens. In addition, educating consumers about livestock to enhance their risk perception could also be another effective means of promoting the purchase of chilled and frozen chicken meat. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new, highly consequential setting for the use of computer vision for environmental sustainability. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) (aka intensive livestock farms or "factory farms") produce significant manure and pollution. Dumping manure in the winter months poses significant environmental risks and violates environmental law in many states. Yet the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies have relied primarily on self-reporting to monitor such instances of "land application."Our paper makes four contributions. First, we introduce the environmental, policy, and agricultural setting of CAFOs and land application. Second, we provide a new dataset of high-cadence (daily to weekly) 3m/pixel satellite imagery from 2018-20 for 330 CAFOs in Wisconsin with hand labeled instances of land application (n=57,697). Third, we develop an object detection model to predict land application and a system to perform inference in near real-time. We show that this system effectively appears to detect land application (PR AUC = 0.93) and we uncover several outlier facilities which appear to apply regularly and excessively. Last, we estimate the population prevalence of land application events in Winter 2021/22. We show that the prevalence of land application is much higher than what is self-reported by facilities. The system can be used by environmental regulators and interest groups, one of which piloted field visits based on this system this past winter. Overall, our application demonstrates the potential for AI-based computer vision systems to solve major problems in environmental compliance with near-daily imagery. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis are important protozoan parasites which are associated with diarrheal diseases in humans and animals worldwide. Relatively little is known about the molecular epidemiology of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis in the Middle East Countries and North Africa (MENA region). Therefore, this review aimed to inspect published genotyping and subtyping studies on Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis in the MENA region. These studies indicate that both anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium occurs with the predominance of zoonotic transmission in most countries. Seven Cryptosporidium species were identified in humans (C. parvum, C. hominis, Cryptosporidium meleagridis, C. felis, Cryptosporidium muris, C. canis and C. bovis), with C. parvum by far being the most prevalent species (reported in 95.4% of the retrieved studies). Among C. parvum gp60 subtype families, IIa and IId predominated, suggesting potential zoonotic transmission. However, in four MENA countries (Lebanon, Israel, Egypt and Tunisia), C. hominis was the predominant species with five subtype families reported including Ia, Ib, Id, If and Ie, all of which are usually anthroponotically transmitted between humans. In animals, the majority of studies were conducted mainly on livestock and poultry, 15 species were identified (C. parvum, C. hominis, C. muris, Cryptosporidium cuniculus, C. andersoni, C. bovis, C. meleagridis, C. baileyi, C. erinacei, C. ryanae, C. felis, C. suis, Cryptosporidium galli, C. xiaoi and C. ubiquitum) with C. parvum (IIa and IId subtypes) the dominant species in livestock and C. meleagridis and C. baileyi the dominant species in poultry. With G. duodenalis, five assemblages (A, B, C, E and F) were identified in humans and six (A, B, C, E, D and F) in animals in MENA countries with assemblages A and B commonly reported in humans, and assemblages A and E dominant in livestock. This review also identified a major knowledge gap in the lack of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis typing studies in water and food sources in the MENA region. Of the few studies conducted on water sources (including drinking and tap water), ten Cryptosporidium species and four genotypes were identified, highlighting the potential role of water as the major route of Cryptosporidium spp. transmission in the region. In addition, three G. duodenalis assemblages (A, B and E) were detected in different water sources with AI, AII and BIV being the main sub-assemblages reported. More research is required in order to better understand the molecular diversity and transmission dynamics of Cryptsporidum spp. and Giardia duodenalis in humans, animals, water and food sources in MENA region. © 2022 The Authors},

The design detailed the arrangement of sensors and actuators, using Python language that was controlled through a Raspberry Pi applied by an On-Off controller, the harmony of sensors and actuators were achieved through a mathematical analysis supported by the knowledge of 2 systems such as aquaculture and hydroponics, the combination of this is called aquaponics. As a result, in aquaculture, it was possible to simulate the control of the water level and control the temperature, pH, and oxygen ranges, in hydroponics it was possible to control the humidity and temperature, making the aquaponic system create favorable conditions for the growth and development of the plants. In summary, constant control of sensors and actuators was obtained in a Raspberry Pi proving to be robust for the development of the aquaponic system in an industrial way, achieving the automation of the camera.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The optimization and implementation of artificial insemination (AI) in sheep is necessary to increase the livestock productivity through enhanced control of reproductive function. Sperm centrifugation is a common procedure in the ejaculate handling in AI and other assisted reproductive technologies (ART), as part of new methods of sperm analysis, selection or preservation. However, our research group previously established that this simple procedure might cause a large sperm loss and induce deleterious effects on the sperm function of the ovine species when high centrifugation forces are employed. To our knowledge, there are no studies on combined effect of extender and different centrifugal forces on ram sperm yield and quality. Furthermore, evidence of in vivo fertility rate using sperm obtained with various centrifugation forces is also lacking in this species. Thus, the objective of this work was to define the ideal conditions for ram semen centrifugation that will achieve the best quantity and quality sample to ensure unaffected fertilization ability of centrifuged ram sperm. The Experiment 1 evaluated the effect of the centrifugation procedure of two extenders (INRA 96 and Tyrode's) and two cooling protocols (Rapid and Slow Refrigeration −35 °C to 15 °C–) on sperm recovery rate and quality (motility and kinetic parameters, viability, apoptosis and mitochondrial activity). INRA 96 combined with Slow Refrigeration and Tyrode's at room temperature registered the highest sperm recovery and quality values (P ≤ 0.05). In Experiment 2, the influence of three centrifugal forces (600, 1200 and 6000×g for 10 min) was assessed immediately after centrifugation on the technical performance and sperm functionality in diluted samples with INRA 96 and Tyrode's at the conditions set out in Experiment 1. The lowest pellet weight (P ≤ 0.05) without harmful effect on sperm physiological status (P > 0.05) was achieved at 1200×g, since 6000×g induced sperm motility damage (P ≤ 0.05) with both extenders. Finally, to ensure the total safety of the centrifugation protocol, Experiment 3 tested in a combined in vitro and in vivo test the effect of these three centrifugal forces on ram sperm quality after dilution (INRA 96) and liquid storage (6–8 h at 15 °C). The damage produced by 6000×g on sperm motility (P ≤ 0.05) was maintained over time, coinciding with a lower fertility (P ≤ 0.05). In conclusion, ram sperm can be centrifuged in INRA 96 extender up to 1200×g for 10 min at 15 °C as secure values with high recovery rates and without detrimental effects on sperm quality and fertility. © 2022},

A total of 51 FMD/AI control workers participated in 16 sessions of an EAL program facilitated by therapeutic riding professionals and trained horses. Results showed significant changes in their stress level, coping style, and overall quality of life-related to health, most notably increased vitality, enhanced emotional and social functioning, greater problem-solving, and less social avoidance after EAL participation. The usefulness of equine-assisted activities and the association between more significant stress coping ability and improved functioning in various areas of life are consistent with previous research findings.

	abstract = {Urban agriculture can be shortly defined as the growing of plants and/or the livestock husbandry in and around cities. Although it has been a common occupation for the urban population all along, recently there is a growing interest in it both from public bodies and researchers, as well as from ordinary citizens who want to engage in self-cultivation. The modern citizen, though, will hardly find the free time to grow his own vegetables as it is a process that requires, in addition to knowledge and disposition, consistency. Given the above considerations, the purpose of this work was to develop an economic robotic system for the automatic monitoring and management of an urban garden. The robotic system was designed and built entirely from scratch. It had to have suitable dimensions so that it could be placed in a balcony or a terrace, and be able to scout vegetables from planting to harvest and primarily conduct precision irrigation based on the growth stage of each plant. Fertigation and weed control will also follow. For its development, a number of technologies were combined, such as Cartesian robots’ motion, machine vision, deep learning for the identification and detection of plants, irrigation dosage and scheduling based on plants’ growth stage, and cloud storage. The complete process of software and hardware development to a robust robotic platform is described in detail in the respective sections. The experimental procedure was performed for lettuce plants, with the robotic system providing precise movement of its actuator and applying precision irrigation based on the specific needs of the plants. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The cattle breeding industry, through both of its derivatives (dairy and beef), provides 81% of milk and 22% of meat required globally. If a breeding bull is sub-fertile, this impacts herd conception and birth rates, and it is generally accepted that having a proactive genetic screening programme can prevent further losses. Chromosome translocations are the leading genetic cause of infertility in livestock and, in cattle, this extends beyond the classical 1:29 to other Robertsonian translocations (RobTs) and to reciprocal translocations (RECTs). The incidence of both (collectively termed RTs) varies between breeds and herds; however, we estimate that RECTs are, most likely, at least twice as common as RobTs. The purpose of this study was to develop an industry economic model to estimate the financial impact of an RT event at the herd level. If we assume a conservative incidence rate of 0.4% for Rob1:29 with each one impacting the conception rate by 5%, we calculate that actively screening for and removing a Rob1:29 bull could benefit an impacted herd by GBP 2.3 million (approx. USD 2.8 million) over six years. A recently updated screening protocol developed in our lab for all RTs, however (with a projected combined incidence of 1.2%, impacting conception rates by 10%), could benefit an impacted herd by GBP 7.2 million (nearly USD 9 million) for each RT found. For an industry worth USD 827.4 billion (dairy) and USD 467.7 billion (beef), expanding knowledge on incidence and further dissection of the potential costs (financial and environmental) from RTs is essential to prevent further losses. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Meat is one of the main sources of protein in human nutrition. During recent years meat production volume has been showing significant growth worldwide. The total growth of red meat production is expected to show an 80% increase by 2029, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development (OECD). Such growth indicates the necessity for existing production line modernisation to satisfy future increased demand for meat products. Scope and approach: This article critically reviews automation challenges for robotic applications in the meat industry, among those are heterogeneity of meat pieces and inconsistency of cutting trajectories that must be overcome to achieve the final quality product. It specifically focuses on human-robot collaboration (HRC) that could be applied in the meat industry to address these challenges. The paper elaborates on possible adaptation of HRC in meat industry, based on its achievements in other industries. Key finding and conclusions: With increased customisation for both hardware and software robots can offer a flexible, scalable, compact and cost-effective production line alternative to older machinery that require large floor space, are difficult to adapt and include higher maintenance costs. However, in the case of red meat industry there are no off-the-shelf robotic solutions that can cover all the production steps in the secondary meat processing. Introducing collaborative robots into meat processing could help to promote higher standards in food safety and human-working conditions in the industry and make automation more affordable for smaller production plants. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {In fragile ecosystems, smallholder pig production systems provide food and nutritional security to resource-poor communities. Pigs are the main livestock raised by indigenous communities in the Himalayan region of India, but their productivity is low for several reasons. The present study aimed to study the pig herd size and to evaluate the impact of artificial insemination (AI) on profitability and sustainability in the small-holder pig production system. A total of 612 AIs were carried out in 483 sows in the farmer's field along with 114 sows that underwent natural breeding. A comparison was made between the reproductive performance of sows following AI and natural breeding. The profitability and economics of AI and natural breeding were also compared. The mean pig population varied from 4.75 to 6.42 in the study region. The farrowing rate, total born piglets (TBPs), and live born piglets (LBPs) were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in artificially inseminated sows compared to naturally bred sows (9.37 vs. 6.28; 8.93 vs. 5.45). Farrowing rate (P = 0.005), TBP, and LBP were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in sows inseminated by female inseminator as compared to male inseminator (81.26 vs. 71.42%; 9.65 vs. 8.80; 9.21 vs. 8.38). The insemination by uneducated farmers resulted in significantly (P = 0.002) lower farrowing rate, TBP (P < 0.001), LBP (P < 0.001), and AI per farrowing (P = 0.042). The farmers who did AI for the third time and more than three times recorded significantly (P < 0.001) higher farrowing rates, TBP, and LBP. The farrowing rate was significantly (P < 0.001) less in sows that were located more than 30 km away from the semen center (66.66 vs. 82.90%). The net return per sow was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in artificially inseminated sows (US$464.8 vs. US$248.11). AI resulted in an 87.33% increase in net returns per farrowing as compared to natural breeding. In conclusion, AI in smallholder pig production systems has the potential to sustainably improve the profitability as well as the food and nutritional security of resource-poor farmers.

	abstract = {Livestock management involves the monitoring of farm animals by tracking certain physiological and phenotypical characteristics over time. In the dairy industry, for instance, cattle are typically equipped with RFID ear tags. The corresponding data (e.g. milk properties) can then be automatically assigned to the respective cow when they enter the milking station. In order to move towards a more scalable, affordable, and welfare-friendly approach, automatic non-invasive solutions are more desirable. Thus, a non-invasive approach is proposed in this paper for the automatic identification of individual Holstein cattle from the side view while exiting a milking station. It considers input images from a thermal-RGB camera. The thermal images are used to delineate the cow from the background. Subsequently, any occluding rods from the milking station are removed and inpainted with the fast marching algorithm. Then, it extracts the RGB map of the segmented cattle along with a novel CORF3D contour map. The latter contains three contour maps extracted by the Combination of Receptive Fields (CORF) model with different strengths of push–pull inhibition. This mechanism suppresses noise in the form of grain type texture. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by means of experiments using a 5-fold and a leave-one day-out cross-validation on a new data set of 3694 images of 383 cows collected from the Dairy Campus in Leeuwarden (the Netherlands) over 9 days. In particular, when combining RGB and CORF3D maps by late fusion, an average accuracy of 99.64%(±0.13) was obtained for the 5-fold cross validation and 99.71%(±0.31) for the leave-one day-out experiment. The two maps were combined by first learning two ConvNet classification models, one for each type of map. The feature vectors in the two FC layers obtained from training images were then concatenated and used to learn a linear SVM classification model. In principle, the proposed approach with the novel CORF3D contour maps is suitable for various image classification applications, especially where grain type texture is a confounding variable. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Robotic milking systems (RMS) are increasingly utilised by modern livestock farmers because they can reduce labour costs, and they have the potential to collect data that will improve animal welfare and animal productivity through better monitoring. Sensors and devices installed in RMS enable farmers to routinely collect data on environment conditions, individual animal's behaviours, health, productivity, and milk quality. This dataset can be used to train artificial intelligence algorithms to predict trends in these variables. This study developed a machine learning framework using 5 years' behaviour, heath and productivity data from 80 cows in a robotic dairy farm. Here we demonstrate the development of a framework to automatically train models with up-to-date farm data and predict daily milk yield, composition (fat and protein content) and frequency of individual cow milking during the subsequent 28 days. A time series cross-validation was applied to simulate the application of this framework under commercial conditions and to evaluate the performance. A high accuracy of prediction (R2 > 0.90 and overall accuracy > 80%) was achieved with the models created by this framework. The practical potential of using such frameworks to enhance the management efficiency and animal welfare in robotic dairy farms is discussed. © 2022 IAgrE},

	abstract = {Minimizing the manpower in production, mechanization and automation has made its impact felt in the field of agriculture and animal husbandry in recent years. In the livestock sector, information on the health, production and reproduction of animals is automatically collected and interpreted to provide guiding information to the operators, and the software written specifically in this direction is rapidly increasing. In dairy and beef cattle, this type of software is called “herd tracking system”. Although there are many software used in the market, a small number of herd tracking systems, which are advantageous with the services they provide or the hardware they have, and which are preferred more intensely, constitute an oligopoly market. The power of being preferred contributes to R&D and investment budgets, and this increases the preferability of software. The criteria that users consider when choosing the program: It varies according to the business structure (dairy/fattening focused) and subjective requests. The criteria accepted as basic are not subject to an objective measurement system. At this point, since the comparison of the alternatives according to the criteria is made based on the linguistic expressions of the users, the ranking process has a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problem structure. In this study, four different herd tracking software were ranked according to seven different criteria. The CRITIC method was used to weigh the criteria, and the fuzzy ARAS and fuzzy TOPSIS methods were used to rank the alternatives. As a result of the findings obtained from the analyses, the four major herd tracking software were ranked according to seven different criteria. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Modern meat processing requires automation and robotisation to remain sustainable and adapt to future challenges, including those brought by global infection events. Automation of all or many processes is seen as the way forward, with robots performing various tasks instead of people. Meat cutting is one of these tasks. Smart novel solutions, including smart knives, are required, with the smart knife being able to analyse and predict the meat it cuts. This paper aims to review technologies with the potential to be used as a so-called “smart knife” The criteria for a smart knife are also defined. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews various technologies that can be used, either alone or in combination, for developing a future smart knife for robotic meat cutting, with possibilities for their integration into automatic meat processing. Optical methods, Near Infra-Red spectroscopy, electrical impedance spectroscopy, force sensing and electromagnetic wave-based sensing approaches are assessed against the defined criteria for a smart knife. Findings: Optical methods are well established for meat quality and composition characterisation but lack speed and robustness for real-time use as part of a cutting tool. Combining these methods with artificial intelligence (AI) could improve the performance. Methods, such as electrical impedance measurements and rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry, are invasive and not suitable in meat processing since they damage the meat. One attractive option is using athermal electromagnetic waves, although no commercially developed solutions exist that are readily adaptable to produce a smart knife with proven functionality, robustness or reliability. Originality/value: This paper critically reviews and assesses a range of sensing technologies with very specific requirements: to be compatible with robotic assisted cutting in the meat industry. The concept of a smart knife that can benefit from these technologies to provide a real-time “feeling feedback” to the robot is at the centre of the discussion. © 2021, Alex Mason, Dmytro Romanov, L.

	abstract = {Facing the manifold sustainability challenges (GHG emissions, eutrophication, social welfare, etc.) in livestock farming, Digital Twins can help farmers to use available feed and nutrients efficiently, monitor livestock health, and control emissions to air, soil, and water. Combined with current precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies, Digital Twins (DT) enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and automation capabilities through real-world models and a two-way flow of information. As current applications are mostly focused on closed and highly regulated systems, this paper investigates the systemic challenges and associated design implications of DTs in complex PLF settings. By integrating a STES (social-technical-ecological system) design approach, the authors argue to foster design strategies that serve sustainable livestock governance and enable a sound and flexible basis for balancing associated engineering requirements such as privacy, security, ethics, and inclusion. We will use a qualitative assessment approach, discuss multi-disciplinary requirements for Digital Twins, and consolidate them in a high-level road-map. © ECPLF 2022. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research was performed to detect tissue fatty acid (FA) composition and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content in Anatolian buffaloes at different muscle types (MTs) and slaughter weights (SWs). The research was carried out on a private commercial livestock farm in Tokat. The research’s animal material comprised 20 Anatolian buffalo calves with approximately 100 kg body weights, weaned at about 150 days of age. Before the experiment started, the calves were randomly divided into two slaughter groups (SW) as low weight (LW=225 kg) and high weight (HW=325 kg). Ten calves from each of the two experimental groups, which were intensively fed, were slaughtered in two different weights. After the slaughtering, FA composition and CLA content of the Semimembranosus(SM), Semitendinosus (ST), and Triceps brachii (TB) muscle tissues of the animals were examined. The study determined that palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and stearic acid (C18:0) were affected by MTs and oleic acid (C18:1) and α-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) were affected by SW (P < 0.05). The highest CLA was in the ST muscle type (0.298) and the LW group (0.289) of the SW groups (P > 0.05). With the increase of SW (in LW and HW groups), n-6/n3 (SM: 7.783 and 6.533; ST: 8.115 and 7.859; TB: 8.416 and 8.215) (P > 0.05) and PUFA ratio decreased (P < 0.05). The SW increase raised the SFA ratio in the SM muscle (P < 0.05) while lowering it in the TB muscle (P > 0.05). Again, with the increase in SW, AI and TI values increased in SM and ST muscles, while the same index values decreased in TB muscle (P > 0.05). In conclusion, when considering the PUFA/SFA ratio and the beneficial effects of CLAs on human health, ST in the MT and LW groups in SW, and thus ST and LW in MT and SW were prominent in Anatolian buffaloes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial characteristics and anti-biofilm ability of epsilon-poly-lysine hydrochloride (ε-PLH) against Listeria monocytogenes. Minimum inhibitory concentration of ε-PLH against L. monocytogenes was 16 μg/ml. Scanning electron microscopy showed that ε-PLH damaged the morphology of tested bacterial cells. The decrease in cell metabolic activity and two intracellular enzymes of β-galactosidase and ATPase, and the increase of electrical conductivity, protein, and absorbance at 260 nm in the treated suspension indicated that cell membranes were broken by ε-PLH, which caused leakage of ions and intracellular materials of L. monocytogenes. Moreover, ε-PLH at maximum sublethal concentration significantly repressed the biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide production, and cell adhesion, which was consistent with the reduction of swimming and AI-2 activity. Finally, ε-PLH was applied to preserve refrigerated beef steak and showed the remarkable anti-listerial activity and improvement of sensory quality. Practical applications: Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that can cause invasive severe human cases of listeriosis. Although initial contamination levels in foods are usually low, the ability of these bacteria to survive and multiply at low temperatures allows it to reach levels high enough to cause disease. Furthermore, biofilm cells of L. monocytogenes are more resistant to cleaning and disinfectants than planktonic cells, leading to their survival for lengthy periods in food processing plant environment. Moreover, epsilon-poly-lysine hydrochloride (ε-PLH) as homopolymer of epsilon-poly-lysine (ε-PL) becomes currently the main product due to lower price and more stable during storage compared with ε-PL. At present, ε-PL with antimicrobial properties is well documented, however, there is little research on the effect of ε-PLH on the planktonic and biofilm cells of L. monocytogenes. This work may provide a reference for the development of new efficient and economic preservatives in controlling L. monocytogenes in the meat processing industry. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {The ‘domestication syndrome’ defines a suite of features that domesticated animals possess as the result of the artificial selection operated by Homo sapiens since the Neolithic. An interesting anthropological question is whether such features, including increased tameness and reduced aggression, apply to all domesticated forms. We investigated this issue in the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). We video-recorded and analysed aggression and social play (mostly play-fighting) sessions from piglets (three litters; n = 24) and wild boar hybrids (domestic pig mother x wild boar father; three litters; n = 27) from 6–50 days of age, raised in the same woodland/grassland habitat and extensive farming management (ethical farm ‘Parva Domus’, Cavagnolo, Torino). Play and aggression session structure was assessed via Asymmetry (AI; offensive/defensive pattern balance), Shannon (H′; pattern variability), and Pielou (J; pattern evenness) indices. We found that piglets played more (especially after the 20th day of life) and engaged in less variable and uniform sessions than wild boar hybrids. Compared to hybrids, piglets showed less variable but more frequent (especially when approaching weaning) and asymmetrical aggressive events. Thus, the domestication syndrome does not seem to fully apply to either social play or aggression, possibly because artificial selection has produced greater tameness of pigs towards humans than towards conspecifics. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The occurrence and species/genotypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia duodenalis infecting young livestock in selected districts of Tigray, Ethiopia were investigated, along with risks associated with infection. A total of 757 faecal samples were collected from calves, lambs, and goat kids from four rural districts in Tigray, and also from calves in periurban Mekelle, Tigray's main city, and analysed for Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts. Farmers answered questionnaires regarding potential risk factors at sample collection. Immunofluorescent antibody staining was used for parasite detection, and PCR at selected genes and sequencing of positive samples was used for molecular characterisation. The occurrence of Cryptosporidium infection was 10, 9, and 4% in calves, lambs, and goat kids, respectively; equivalent figures for Giardia infection were 39, 32, and 21%. Molecular characterisation of Cryptosporidium isolates revealed C. ubiquitum, subtype XIIa in all three host species; C. ryanae in calves and goat kids; C. andersoni and C. bovis were identified only in calves, and C. xiaoi was identified in lambs. For Giardia, Assemblage E predominated in all host species, but among calf isolates we also identified a few potentially zoonotic genotypes (assemblages A (AI) and Assemblage B). Periparturient care was shown to be a particularly relevant risk factor for infection, and infections were less likely to occur under extensive management systems. Our major findings were widespread occurrence of both parasites in livestock, and the apparent lack of the most common zoonotic species. Our results are discussed in relation to other relevant studies. As our study was conducted in Tigray, further investigation in different settings in Ethiopia could provide relevant information on transmission and zoonotic potential. In addition, given the dependency on healthy animals for the livelihoods of the population of Tigray, investigation of the effect of these common parasites on livestock productivity is important.

	abstract = {As the pig industry develops rapidly, various problems are appearing both inside and outside the pig houses. In particular, in the case of pig houses, it is difficult to solve the main problems even if automation and mechanization are applied with ICT technology. The main current issues are: (1) preventing infectious diseases amongst livestock, (2) reducing the emission of harmful gas and odors, (3) improving the growth environment inside the pig house, (4) reducing energy costs, (5) improving the farm management and operating system, and 6) improving the livestock product quality. Air recirculation technology can be applied as a technology that can solve these typical problems in the pig industry. An air-recirculated ventilation system can minimize the inflow of air from outdoors and recycle the internal thermal energy of the pig house. The air-recirculated ventilation system consists of (1) an air scrubber module, (2) external air-mixing module, (3) UV cleaning module, (4) solar heat module, and (5) air-distribution module. First, in this study, the field data were collected to analyze the main problems of the target piglet house for the application of the air-recirculated ventilation system. In addition, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and validated for seasonal aerodynamic analysis. The applicability of the air-recirculated ventilation system was evaluated based on the CFD computed results for various environmental conditions. As a result of evaluating the internal environment according to the ventilation rates and external-air-mixing ratio of the air-recirculated ventilation system, the required ventilation rate and external air-mixing ratio to maintain the proper temperature and gas concentration were determined. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The continuous monitoring of livestock behaviour is an important task in precision livestock farming. An early recognition of critical events in a herd can lead to an improved animal welfare and thus for example in a reduced need of antibiotics. Furthermore, it has been found that even feeding intake and efficiency can be affected by animal behaviour. Due to the size of modern livestock farming operations, the usage of automated systems becomes necessary. We present a scalable automated monitoring system composed of low-cost IP video surveillance cameras and affordable edge-computing hardware on-site, complemented by standardized web services that allow for long term video storage and analysis. For the automated analysis of eating- and resting time as well as activity levels in videos, we perform state-of-the-art object detection and tracking using a YOLOv3 DeepSORT Convolutional Neural Network. Data management and the integration of the analysis system into the farmers’ work-flows are achieved using a distributed service interoperability network that allows the exchange of data between different services related to livestock management. The interoperability network is completely federated and based on established web technologies. Interoperability is achieved through standardized APIs and data formats. This enables farmers for example to seamlessly integrate behaviour analysis results into feeding management systems, or to share the results with external consultancy services or other stakeholders in the production chain. Furthermore, the standardized data exchange removes the extra workload that is caused by entering the same data into different systems. © ECPLF 2022. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The automation of stimulus-controlled operant conditioning gains more and more relevance in management applications for farm animals. Recent examples are solutions for virtual fencing and latrine training. Such systems need to assess the learning progress of the animals in order not to overburden their adaptive capacity. Classically, the learning progress is evaluated based on the displayed behaviour using metrics for classification performance. However, the preconditions for applying these metrics, such as clear behavioural motivation and free access to the training device, are no longer given if the training is conducted with group-housed animals. In this case, such metrics may only serve as a heuristic for the learning progress and have to fulfil certain plausibility criteria to be applicable. These properties were investigated in a study based on an exemplary signal discrimination task. This task was used to condition adult sows under three training conditions that differed in group size and the number of training opportunities. The study evaluated the suitability of sensitivity and precision - two metrics commonly used to measure classification performance. The results indicate that both metrics do not provide plausible results whereas a newly developed metric called normalized precision does. © ECPLF 2022. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sperm cryopreservation contributes to the extensive utilization of artificial insemination (AI) in the daily livestock industry. However, due to the presence of few sperm with good biological function in post-thaw goat sperm, its use has been limited for AI purposes. Hence, its improvement has been the focus of many research studies. This study aimed to investigate the effects of proline supplementation of the freezing medium on goat sperm. The goat semen was cryopreserved with freezing medium supplementation of different concentrations of proline (0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mM). The post-thaw sperm motility patterns, membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) activity, superoxide dis-mutase (SOD) activity, glutathione (GSH) levels and GSH/GSSG were evaluated. Likewise, the expression and immunofluorescent localization of PRODH in post-thaw goat sperm was also detected. It was observed that addition of 2 mM proline to the freezing medium significantly enhanced post-thaw goat sperm total motility, progressive motility, straight-linear velocity (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL), average path velocity (VAP), straightness (STR), linearity (LIN), membrane integrity and acrosome integrity. Interestingly, PRODH was expressed in post-thaw goat sperm, especially in the post-acrosome and sperm tail. Addition of 2 mM proline also significantly increased the post-thaw sperm PRODH activity compared to the control. Moreover, post-thaw goat sperm LPO levels and MDA levels were reduced by supplementation of 2 mM proline. Furthermore, compared to the control, the values of post-thaw goat sperm T-AOC, SOD activity, GSH level and GSH/GSSG were also significantly increased in 2 mM proline treatment. Reduction of post-thaw goat sperm apoptosis in 2 mM proline treatment was also observed as the levels of Caspase3 and Caspase9 were decreased by the supplementation with 2 mM proline. These observations suggest that the addition of 2 mM proline to the freezing medium increased post-thaw goat sperm quality by reducing oxidative stress during cryopreservation. These findings also provide novel insights into the use of proline as an efficient additive to enhance post-thaw goat sperm quality during cryopreservation. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Automation is a key technology for a sustainable and secure meat sector in the future, both in terms of productivity and work environment. New robotic technologies, such as the so-called 'meat factory cell,' (MFC) aim to contribute to this goal, but they require new 'smart' tools that provide sensor feedback, which enable robots to perform complex tasks. This article presents one such tool: the smart knife, which gives real-time feedback on its contact status with meat, as well as cutting depth. The tool and the system are described, and its operation evidenced via electromagnetic (EM) simulation using the Ansys High-Frequency Structure Simulator. Furthermore, the performance of the knife is validated using pork loin meat: in the worst case, knife is shown to have an error of 1.78% for contact detection, and a mean error of 7.66 mm (±1.45 mm) for depth detection. This article also presents brief discussion regarding eventual use of the knife as part of the MFC control system, in addition to future work to be performed. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Chinese poultry industry continues to use cages for growing both broiler and layer chickens in most commercial facilities with no plans to ban their use in the immediate future. In contrast, cages have been banned and are being phased out in Europe. In particular, broilers are and have been kept in large flocks on a littered floor. Both systems however, do have issues related to indoor environment, health and welfare. Various precision livestock farming (PLF) inspired systems have been developed to better monitor and thus improve the climatic conditions for floor based poultry systems (RoboChick, Octopus, ChickenBoy) For the caged housing system, a large consortium of Chinese and UK industry and academia developed a dedicated autonomous data collection platform. The data platform combines robot technology with advanced sensors and indoor environmental management using real-time monitoring to maintain the best environmental and animal welfare conditions, improving production yield, and providing early detection of poultry disease and minimal anti-biotics use. The prototype autonomous navigating robot was developed in the UK and fitted with the sensors and datalogging systems. A bespoke user interface was developed to map the environment the robot would be operating in and allow assignment of monitoring positions. The navigation systems were tested in a caged poultry facility in the UK and proven to be highly accurate and reliable in positioning the robot and avoiding obstacles essential for autonomous operation. The jointly developed monitoring systems were integrated with the platforms software and bespoke cloud based databases. © ECPLF 2022. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Transboundary animal diseases (TADs) pose a serious threat to the sustainability and economic viability of the existing animal agriculture ecosystem in south Asia. The rapid spread of African swine fever and lumpy skin diseases in south Asia must be considered a wake-up call to prevent the entry, spread, and establishment of new exotic TADs, as south Asia has the highest density of livestock populations, and it will have a huge socioeconomic impact. Regional cooperation for the prevention and control of TADs is necessary, but rational decisions should be made to initiate even sub-regional cooperation in the present geopolitical situation. Cross-border collaboration for surveillance, early warnings, and animal movement control should be encouraged on a bilateral or multilateral basis as many countries share a porous border. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and avian influenza (AI) have been identified as regional priority TADs, and many regional and country initiatives have been undertaken in the last two decades that need to be translated into action. The incursion of exotic TADs into south Asia has compelled us to rethink overall policies and strategies for prevention and control of TADs. This paper took into consideration six emerging and endemic TADs of viral origin to suggest a future course of action. © 2022 by the authors.},

We aim to evaluate precision agriculture technologies’ practical use in agricultural enterprises in the Czech Republic. The research was based on a questionnaire survey in which 131 farms participated. We validated the hypothesis through a Chi-squared test on the frequency of occurrence of end-use technology. The results showed that precision farming technologies are used more in crop than livestock production. In particular, 58.02% of enterprises use intelligent weather stations, 89.31% use uncrewed vehicles, and 61.83% use navigation and optimisation systems for optimising journeys. These technologies are the most used and closely related to autonomous driving and robotics in agriculture. The results indicate how willing are agricultural enterprises to adopt new technologies. For policy makers, these findings show which precision farming technologies are already implemented. This can make it easier to direct funding towards grants and projects. © 2022 by the authors.},

This study involves an intelligent agriculture management system to produce agricultural benefits and crop production. The hybrid remote-controlled device used the Global Positioning System (GPS) with Radial Function Network (RFN) was proposed to control the irrigated system, predict the temperature, maintain the air pressure, and reduced the humidity in water content. It uses IoT sensors and the Internet of Everything (IOE) environmental data for managing and monitors intelligent solar irrigation systems. The objective is agriculture intelligent by using automation and IoT technologies. It scientifically designed to perform tasks such as weeding, irrigation, sensing humidity, attempting to scare birds and livestock, maintaining surveillance, etc., to control the geolocation of devices remotely. As a result, the design is to achieve all of its goals in terms of water use; total running costs decreased labour, energy consumption, and productivity.

	abstract = {As the pig industry develops rapidly, various problems are increasing both inside and outside pig houses. In particular, in the case of pig houses, it is difficult to solve the main problems even if automation and mechanization are applied with Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). The air recirculation technology can be applied as a technology that can solve these typical problems in the pig industry, such as growth environment, livestock disease, odor emission, energy cost, and pig productivity. The air recirculated ventilation system (ARVS) can minimize the inflow of air from the outdoors and recycle the internal thermal energy of the pig house. The ARVS consists of (1) an air scrubber module, (2) an external air mixing module, (3) a UV cleaning module, (4) a solar heat module, and (5) an air distribution module. In this study, the growth environment of piglets was predicted using a numerical model when the ARVS was applied. Since the concept of air recirculation was used, numerous equations for predicting the internal environment should be iteratively calculated. Furthermore, it was necessary to determine the optimum condition of the modules by applying various boundary conditions. Therefore, the model was designed for numerical analysis based on the balance equations of environmental factors inside the piglet room. For each module, the module coefficient and equations were considered based on the previous studies. The analysis was conducted according to the system diagram of each module, and the growth environment inside the piglet room was evaluated according to the various environmental conditions. As a result of calculating the numerical model, the ventilation rate of 40 CMM or more was advantageous to properly maintaining the gas environment. In the summer season, it was necessary to additionally use the cooling device and dehumidifier. In the winter season, when using a heat exchanger and solar module, was more advantageous for maintaining air temperature inside the piglet room. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The invasive annual grass downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) is a critical threat to the semiarid shrublands that characterize western North America. More abundant fine fuel after invasion typically increases fire frequency in plant communities adapted to relatively infrequent burning, reducing the likelihood of native plant persistence. Currently, imazapic is most often used to manage B. tectorum, but reinvasion from the seedbank after treatment is common. Indaziflam is a newer herbicide recently labeled for use in rangelands grazed by livestock, and many research trials have demonstrated its ability to deplete invasive annual grass seedbanks. We evaluated the effectiveness of indaziflam and imazapic for reducing B. tectorum density and cover over a period of approximately 5 yr (57 mo after treatment [MAT]) at two invaded sagebrush-grassland sites near Pinedale, WY. Treatments included three different indaziflam rates (51, 73, and 102 g ai ha-1) and one imazapic rate (123 g ai ha-1), and these treatments were reapplied to half of each plot at 45 MAT to evaluate the effects of two sequential applications. We also measured perennial grass cover, because positive perennial grass responses were observed after release from B. tectorum competition in other studies, and perennial grasses may provide resistance to B. tectorum reinvasion. Intermediate and high indaziflam rates (73 and 102 g ha-1, respectively) reduced B. tectorum cover and density at 45 MAT, and perennial grass cover responded positively to some treatments, mostly early in the study (≤33 MAT). Imazapic reduced B. tectorum initially, but did not affect density or cover at either site beyond 21 MAT. Reapplication did not substantially improve B. tectorum control at 57 MAT in plots treated with intermediate and high indaziflam rates, suggesting that long-term control with a single indaziflam treatment may be possible in some cases. © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Seminal plasma (SP) is not a pre-requisite for pregnancy. Yet, this heterogeneous, composite SP has proven relevant for fertility, as mediator for cell-to-cell communication between producing cells, spermatozoa and the female internal genital tract, regulating complex reproductive processes. Bearing hormones, proteins, cytokines as well as nuclei acids in nano-sized lipid bilayer seminal extracellular vesicles (sEVs), the SP concerts signaling to the female. Signals influence timing of ovulation, sperm transport and, particularly, enable the female immune system to balance her cryptic choice to engage into pregnancy or reject an eventual fertilization. This essay, focusing on livestock in general and pigs in particular, discusses the intrinsic roles of sEVs with regards to reproductive homeostasis, while binding and internalizing their cargo in spermatozoa and female tract epithelia to regulate their functional activity. Since prior studies had inconclusive results using bulk SP or single SP-contained free molecules, argumentation is hereby provided to increase the current incipient research on livestock sEVs, where fragile molecules relevant for fertility are shielded from degradation during handling. Seminal EVs isolated from SP can be used for andrological diagnosis and perhaps to select breeders with optimal fertility. Moreover, sEVs can be laboratory-uploaded with specific molecules or even engineered as lipid nanodroplets used as additives for extenders to improve fertility after artificial insemination (AI) or reproductive biotechnologies. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Insect monitoring is critical to improve our understanding and ability to preserve and restore biodiversity, sustainably produce crops, and reduce vectors of human and livestock disease. Conventional monitoring methods of trapping and identification are time consuming and thus expensive. Automation would significantly improve the state of the art. Here, we present a network of distributed wireless sensors that moves the field towards automation by recording backscattered near-infrared modulation signatures from insects. The instrument is a compact sensor based on dual-wavelength infrared light emitting diodes and is capable of unsupervised, autonomous long-term insect monitoring over weather and seasons. The sensor records the backscattered light at kHz pace from each insect transiting the measurement volume. Insect observations are automatically extracted and transmitted with environmental metadata over cellular connection to a cloud-based database. The recorded features include wing beat harmonics, melanisation and flight direction. To validate the sensor’s capabilities, we tested the correlation between daily insect counts from an oil seed rape field measured with six yellow water traps and six sensors during a 4-week period. A comparison of the methods found a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of 0.61 and a p-value = 0.0065, with the sensors recording approximately 19 times more insect observations and demonstrating a larger temporal dynamic than conventional yellow water trap monitoring. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Currently, a different type of tags, tattoos, paint brands and microchips are used to uniquely identify livestock animals. However, the manual identification system is time-consuming, expensive and unreliable. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach that aims to fully automated pipeline for face detection and recognition of goats. Due to the high similarity and the lack of adequate dataset this problem is more complex than human face recognition. We composed two different publicly available datasets for detection and recognition. State-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) model are trained on this dataset. To evaluate the robustness of our approach, we compared it with different face recognition methods. The results show better performance with an accuracy of 96.4%. Furthermore, this paper reports 93%, 83%, 92% and 85% detection accuracy (average precision) for face, eye, nose and ear, respectively. The findings of this research could be helpful to improve animal health and welfare, individual monitoring, activity monitoring and phenotypic data collection.

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 brings transformation to all industries, including agriculture. Smart livestock has been replacing traditional livestock as a trend of the agricultural industry in the world. Precision feeding is one of the areas of smart husbandry that combines many modern multidisciplinary technologies which are prominent such as AI, IoT, Big Data, etc. To obtain that for pigs, a precision feeding system needs to be implemented. Components of the system include automatic feeders connected to a computer system to collect and process data on daily feed intake of fishes and animals, and/or from ambient sensors. Perturbations such as heat stress or sanitation issues have a significant impact on the nutritional profile of group housed pigs. However, perturbation is often detected only after it has occurred and is recognized late by the consequences left on the animal. Although the cause of perturbations might be unknown, the effect on the animal can be observed early throughout the data of voluntary feed intake. By the precision feeding system, the data are processed and analysed based on mathematical models following a two-step approach: (1) estimation of target trajectory of cumulative feed intake using linear and quadratic functions, and (2) detection of perturbations based on deviations from the target cumulative feed intake. However, implementing such a system requires huge costs and is often beyond the capabilities of farms, production households and small/medium laboratories. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based modeling approach to simulate precision feeding systems for swine, whose data can be used to early detect multiple perturbations which may have appeared. Experiments were carried out on GAMA simulation platform to demonstrate the efficiency in detecting multiple perturbations of group housed pigs, and also prove the usefulness of simulation of precision feeding systems. © 2022 IJETAE Publication House.

The increasing demand for compound feed stimulates not only the creation of new enterprises for their production, but also the intensification of production at existing enterprises. When introducing automation systems at enterprises for the animal feed production everywhere including Russia, a typical mistake is the automation of the main production process and the preservation of the auxiliary processes of loading raw materials and finished products' shipment at the mechanization level. The development of computer programs for the practical implementation of required control algorithms can be implemented in universal and special programming languages. As a result of this work, the general algorithms for managing the transferring processes of compound feed at the finished product area were structured. The main subtasks were highlighted, for which the solution algorithms were developed. The use of algorithms for solving the main problems made it possible to form a general algorithm for managing compound feed transfer at the finished product area.

	abstract = {China is the major producer and consumer of pork all around the world. In China, pork production has accounted for more than 60% of meat production for a long time. Nowadays, the pig industry has gradually shifted from decentralized and extensive breeding to intensive large-scale breeding, promoting production efficiency. At present, as people's demand for the quantity and quality of pork is increasing, China's pig industry faces the problem that the output and quality of pork can not meet people's daily needs. With the rise of artificial intelligence technology in recent years, deep learning technology has been developed rapidly and widely used in image and audio recognition, natural language processing, robotics, bioinformatics, chemistry, finance, and other fields. It is also an essential tool in developing precision livestock farming. The body condition, behavior and health status of pigs could directly affect the income level of pig farms, so through using deep learning technology, we can quickly and accurately acquire the relevant information about pigs, and carry out precise management to improve the feeding efficiency and welfare levels of pigs. This paper expounds on the research progress and application status of deep learning technology used in target pig detection, pig image segmentation, pig body condition and abnormal monitoring, as well as pig behavior recognition. Then we put forward the improvement strategy of deep learning technology used in the process of pig feeding, which make it easier for researchers to understand. At the same time, we summarize and analyze the data sources and datasets, application scope, and model optimization of previous works using deep learning technology in pig breeding. In the field of data sources and datasets, mobile computer vision systems are currently more suitable than systems with many fixed cameras when they are applied in pig houses, therefore, further research could focus on how to use deep learning technology to mobile computer vision systems. Deep learning technology requires a large amount of data to learn data features, which is a massive disadvantage for pig applications. To get pre-training weights suitable for agricultural data sets, a large number of public datasets and a unified dataset standard suited to the pig field should be established. In terms of application scope, due to the short application time of deep learning in the process of raising pigs, many critical occasions are not involved or seldom involved in existing research, so the application scope of deep learning should further expand. In model optimization, optimizing the model to meet the needs of practical application scenarios is the direction of future research. Optimizing the model to achieve a better balance between size and model performance requires further study. Optimizing the model to locate the start and end time of the behavior in unclipped video and recognize the behavior of target pigs is the challenge in identifying the behavior of pigs in future. China's research on deep learning is at the top level, so the application prospect of deep learning in pig farming is highly expected. Combined with the actual production scene of pigs, deep learning technology will significantly contribute to the development of precision livestock farming. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Livestock body size parameters are the key indicators to evaluate the production performance of individual and group livestock. Body size parameters can provide an important reference to select excellent breeds. Main phenotypic considerations can also be utilized to select the livestock feed nutrition and the breeding plans. However, the traditional measurement cannot fully meet the high requirements of large-scale production, such as calipers, tape measures, and stick rulers. The manual measurement of the body size of livestock can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, subjective, and invasive at present. More importantly, the invasive measurement is easy to bring stress to livestock, ultimately leading to a detrimental effect on animal welfare. Therefore, it is an ever-increasing demand for the automatic measurement technology of livestock body size in the animal husbandry industry. Most advanced technologies have been applied for the measurement of animal body size, such as digital image processing, machine learning, computer vision, big data, and cloud computing. The automatic measurement technology of livestock body size has achieved better development and progress so far. This review covered the collection and pre-processing of livestock data, the measurement of livestock linear body size, and the measurement of livestock circumferential body size. A full comparison was also made on the general process, commonly-used technology, and research status of automatic measurement for the livestock body size. A specific description was then addressed on the research background and significance, the related concepts, research methods, and application status of automatic measurement for the livestock body size. The first step was the livestock data collection and pre-processing in the automatic measurement of livestock body size. Among them, the visible light camera, depth camera, or LiDAR equipment were used to capture the body surface information of livestock. The digital image processing and computer vision were selected to analyze the livestock images or three-dimensional models. Finally, the dataset was obtained to easily extract the measurement points of livestock bodies. Subsequently, the livestock linear and girth measurements were performed on these datasets. The linear body size mainly included the body length, body width, withers height, chest depth, rump width, and rump height of livestock. Body size parameters were the main reference indicators to reflect the growth status of livestock in the application fields, such as the body condition scoring of dairy cattle, pig body weight estimation, and early diagnosis of livestock diseases. The circumferential body size parameters were also the important reference indicators for the livestock body weight, back fat, meat yield, and skeletal development, including the heart girth, abdominal circumference, and tube circumference of livestock. The circumferential measurement of body size was an indispensable step in the process of livestock breeding. Therefore, the automatic measurement of circumferential body size was developed rapidly in livestock body measurement. New ideas and technologies were emerging in recent years. Three steps were divided, including the points position of body measurement, curve fitting of girth, and size calculation. Some recommendation was also made to promote cost-saving, a high degree of automation, real-time and universality in the field of automatic measurement of livestock body size. The finding can be expected to provide a strong reference for the automatic measurement technology of livestock body size. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Various pathogenic and spoilage bacteria frequently coexist in meat processing environments and can form multispecies biofilms, causing significant health and economic issues. Despite the prevalence and coexistence, only less is known about possible interactions between Listeria monocytogenes (LM) and spoilers like Pseudomonas species, and their community-wide resistance against natural preservatives. This study evaluates the interactions between mono- or dual-species biofilms formed by LM and Pseudomonas lundensis (PL), as well as the sensitivity of these bacteria in dual-species biofilms to ε-polylysine hydrochloride (ε-PLH) alone or combined with cinnamon essential oil (CEO). The results showed that the biofilm cell density of P. lundensis in dual species was higher (p < 0.05) than LM, constituting about 85% of the total population. More biofilms and exopolysaccharide both in mono- or dual species of the two psychrotrophic strains were greatly produced at 15°C than at 30°C. The biomass, biovolume, and thickness of dual-species biofilms were significantly lower than single PL biofilm when tested using crystal violet staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, indicating the competitive interactions between them prevail. Additionally, ε-PLH significantly reduced the biofilm development as mono- and dual species in a concentration-dependent manner, especially single LM biofilm, which was consistent with the decrease in autoinducer-2 (AI-2) activity. LM as dual-species biofilms exhibited lower sensitivity to ε-PLH than its mono-biofilm probably due to protective effect conferred by PL. ε-PLH in combination with CEO, at the maximum sublethal concentrations (MSCs), showed enhanced inhibitory activity against dual-species biofilm formation, as evidenced by thin spare spatial structures and reduced AI-2 activity. In addition, the preformed dual biofilms were dramatically eradicated following treatment with ε-PLH combined with CEO at higher than minimum inhibitory concentration in comparison with either of the compounds used alone, indicating the synergistic antibiofilm of the two preservatives. This study reveals the competitive interactions between the two strains in dual-species biofilms, in which the dominant PL significantly contributed toward the tolerance of LM to ε-PLH, and the use of combined preservatives shows it is an effective strategy to control the multispecies biofilms in meat processing.

This study aimed to develop a face recognition system for dairy farm cows using advanced deep-learning models and computer vision techniques. This approach is non-invasive and potentially applicable to other farm animals of importance for identification and welfare assessment. The video analysis pipeline follows standard human face recognition systems made of four significant steps: (i) face detection, (ii) face cropping, (iii) face encoding, and (iv) face lookup. Three deep learning (DL) models were used within the analysis pipeline: (i) face detector, (ii) landmark predictor, and (iii) face encoder. All DL models were finetuned through transfer learning on a dairy cow dataset collected from a robotic dairy farm located in the Dookie campus at The University of Melbourne, Australia. Results showed that the accuracy across videos from 89 different dairy cows achieved an overall accuracy of 84%. The computer program developed may be deployed on edge devices, and it was tested on NVIDIA Jetson Nano board with a camera stream. Furthermore, it could be integrated into welfare assessment previously developed by our research group. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Economic viability is a fundamental precondition for the practical adoption of innovations in livestock farming. While precision agriculture bears the potential for a drastic reduction of manual labour and resource use, the economic potential of precision livestock farming (PLF) is limited by biological, ethical and ecological boundaries. At the same time, PLF solutions often require complex sensor systems and evaluation methods that increase their cost and lead to long amortisation times. A paradigm shift - from incorporating animals as passive factors that just have to tolerate management procedures to actively collaborating agents - could help to overcome this dead centre. Farm animals have sensory and cognitive abilities that are not matched by current technical systems. Their inclusion could reduce the cost and complexity of technical solutions and thereby may open up new areas for process automation. The key to unlocking these abilities is the establishment of bidirectional communication between animals and machines using automated learning procedures. This would enable the animals to indicate their needs in a way that is better discernible by machines and inversely would allow them to better adapt their behaviour in response to signals given by machines. As a side effect, this more cooperative livestock farming would occupy the animals with biologically relevant tasks and simultaneously improve the controllability and predictability of their husbandry conditions. It could thus directly improve animal welfare and therefore has the potential to increase the revenue per animal if it becomes an element of welfare product labels. © ECPLF 2022.

	abstract = {Change in the frequency of contact between pigs within a group may be indicative of a change in the physiological or health status of one or more pigs within a group, or indicative of the occurrence of abnormal behaviour, e.g. tail-biting. Here, we developed a novel framework that detects and quantifies the frequency of interaction, i.e., a pig head to another pig rear, between pigs in groups. The method does not require individual pig tracking/identification and uses only inexpensive camera-based data capturing infrastructure. We modified the architecture of well-established deep learning models and further developed a lightweight processing stage that scans over pigs to score said interactions. This included the addition of a detection subnetwork to a selected layer of the base residual network. We first validated the automated system to score the interactions between individual pigs within a group, and determined an average accuracy of 92.65% ± 3.74%, under a variety of settings, e.g., management set-ups and data capturing. We then applied the method to a significant welfare challenge in pigs, that of the detection of tail-biting outbreaks in pigs and quantified the changes that happen in contact behaviour during such an outbreak. Our study shows that the system is able to accurately monitor pig interactions under challenging farming conditions, without the need for additional sensors or a pig tracking stage. The method has a number of potential applications to the field of precision livestock farming of pigs that may transform the industry. © 2022 The Author(s)},

In small ruminants, G. duodenalis infection may decrease carcass weight and dressing percentage. Current study was done to determine the prevalence, assemblage distribution, and zoonotic significance of Giardia infection in sheep and goats in Shiraz, southwestern Iran. In total, 200 fecal samples were randomly collected from 100 sheep and 100 goats in 10 farms in Shiraz, southwest of Iran (June 2021-February 2022) and directly examined for G. duodenalis cyst by saline/iodine wet mount examination using a light microscope (400 ×). Positive samples were further genotyped using a nested-PCR and sequencing methods. A mean prevalence of 5.5% (11/200) was estimated for G. duodenalis infection among small ruminants, with 7% and 4% for sheep and goats, respectively. Next, 9 out of 11 positive samples were amplified and only 5 were successfully sequenced at the tpi locus. Our results showed that 80% (4/5) isolates belonged to assemblage E, while only 20% (1/5) were associated with the assemblage A (subtype AI). Of note, 2 E assemblages were isolated from goats and 2 E assemblages plus 1 assemblage A were isolated from sheep. The major finding in the present study was the isolation of assemblage A from sheep in Shiraz, highlighting the zoonotic transmission of Giardia infection in the study area. In general, the information mentioned in the present study is very limited and more extensive studies in this field are needed to achieve more conclusive results. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The world’s growing population is highly dependent on animal agriculture. Animal products provide nutrient-packed meals that help to sustain individuals of all ages in communities across the globe. As the human demand for animal proteins grows, the agricultural industry must continue to advance its efficiency and quality of production. One of the most commonly farmed livestock is poultry and their significance is felt on a global scale. Current poultry farming practices result in the premature death and rejection of billions of chickens on an annual basis before they are processed for meat. This loss of life is concerning regarding animal welfare, agricultural efficiency, and economic impacts. The best way to prevent these losses is through the individualistic and/or group level assessment of animals on a continuous basis. On large-scale farms, such attention to detail was generally considered to be inaccurate and inefficient, but with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted technology individualised, and per-herd assessments of livestock became possible and accurate. Various studies have shown that cameras linked with specialised systems of AI can properly analyse flocks for health concerns, thus improving the survival rate and product quality of farmed poultry. Building on recent advancements, this review explores the aspects of AI in the detection, counting, and tracking of poultry in commercial and research-based applications. © 2022 by the author.

	abstract = {Terrestrial export of nitrogen is a critical Earth system process, but its global dynamics remain difficult to predict at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we use deep learning (DL) to model daily riverine nitrogen export in response to hydrometeorological and anthropogenic drivers. Long short-term memory (LSTM) models for the daily concentration and flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were built in a coastal watershed in southeastern China with a typical subtropical monsoon climate. The DL models exhibited excellent accuracy for both DIN concentration and flux, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients (NSEs) up to 0.67 and 0.92, respectively, a performance unlikely to be achieved by generic process-based models with comparable data quality. The flux model ensemble, without retraining, performed well (mean NSE = 0.32-0.84) in seven distinct watersheds in Asia, Europe, and North America, and retraining with multi-watershed data further improved the lowest NSE from 0.32 to 0.68. DL interpretation confirmed that interbasin consistency of riverine nitrogen export exists across different continents, which stems from the similarities in rainfall-runoff relationships. The multi-watershed flux model projects 0.60-12.4% increases in the nitrogen export to oceans from the studied watersheds under a 20% increase in fertilizer consumption, which rises to 6.7-20.1% with a 10% increase in runoff, indicating the synergistic effect of human activities and climate change. The DL-based method represents a successful case of explainable artificial intelligence in environmental science, providing a potential shortcut to a consistent understanding of the global daily-resolution dynamics of riverine nitrogen export under the currently limited data conditions. © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The aims of the present study were to evaluate the effects of different dry period (DP) lengths on milk fat to protein ratio (FPR) and metabolic status – blood leptin, adiponectin and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations in dairy cows, and their associations with the result of the first timed artificial insemination (TAI). Cows were blocked either to short DP (SDP; 30±2 days; n=72) or con-ventional DP (CDP; 60±2 days; n=76). Milk FPR was calculated at 30 and 60 days in milk (DIM). Body condition score (BCS) was recorded at –60, –30, calving, and 60 DIM. Blood samples were obtained at –60, –30, –7, calving, +7, +30, and +60 DIM for serum metabolites measurement. TAI was implemented between 65–75 DIM for all cows. Milk FPR and its changes were statistically analysed using an independent sample t test. To assess the impact of time, the pattern of BCS, and serum metabolites on the result of the first AI, repeated measure ANOVA was used. Only FPR-30 DIM revealed significant difference between pregnant and non-pregnant cows in SDP group (P<0.01). Reduced BCS loss was observed in the SDP group and followed by slightly higher probability of pregnancy at first AI (P=0.19). Leptin was not altered by shortening the DP (P≥0.1). Significant differences were observed in blood adiponectin prepartum (P<0.001) and at +7 DIM (P<0.01), as well as in NEFA at +7 and +30 DIM between the two groups (P<0.05). Pregnant cows following the first AI had significantly high postpartum leptin concentrations (P<0.05), high prepartum adiponectin (P≤0.001), and lower NEFA at +7 DIM (P<0.01) in the SDP group. In conclusion, shortening the dry period caused reduced BCS loss postpartum and variations in serum metabolits that favoured the possibility of pregnancy at first AI. © 2022, Trakia University.

Some of the objectives are: to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition; to double the agricultural productivity and income of small producers to ensure sustainable food production systems; and to increase investment in rural infrastructure, research and technology development by 2030. From the requirement to increase production efficiency, the concepts of precision livestock farming and digital livestock farming have emerged and are based on the use of technology to monitor and manage the production system efficiently. The fundamental concept of precision agriculture is the management of spatial variability in the field of production. Similarly, precision livestock farming aims to manage the variability of each animal or a group of animals using software, sensors, actuators, and robotics and to collect, store, and process data that provide information for decision-making. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

Digitalisation is increasingly seen as a prerequisite to achieving the goal of sustainable agriculture and reduced labour. Therefore, it is the aim of the DiLaAg project to bring together scientists from different fields of expertise to work interdisciplinary on the complex topic of digitalisation in agriculture. In the DiLaAg consortium, PhD students and their supervisors from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU), the University of Technology Vienna (TU) and the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna (VETMED) build the scientific core. The project was initiated and is funded by the Federal State of Lower Austria and the private foundation ‘Forum Morgen’. The PhD students work in the fields of robotics, image-based plant classification, agronomic analyses of crops, impact of technologies, digital twinning, livestock management on pasture and sustainability assessment as well as on interdisciplinary topics such as computer vision, application of digital sensor technologies, machine learning, complexity science, remote sensing, data integration, precision agriculture and precision livestock farming. Apart from this scientific nucleus, the DiLaAg consortium aims to act as a platform for innovation and exchange, by continuously expanding its network and collaborations in order to continue working on current challenges in agriculture. © ECPLF 2022.

In this article, we present some promising results of applying state of the art object detection and classification techniques to insects, specifically Black Soldier Fly (BSF) and the domestic cricket, with the view of enabling automated processing for insect farming. We also present the low-cost “Insecto” Internet of Things (IoT) device, which provides environmental condition monitoring for temperature, humidity, CO2, air pressure, and volatile organic compound levels together with high resolution image capture. We show that we are able to accurately count and measure size of BSF larvae and also classify the sex of domestic crickets by detecting the presence of the ovipositor. These early results point to future work for enabling automation in the selection of desirable phenotypes for subsequent generations and for providing early alerts should environmental conditions deviate from desired values.

	abstract = {Computer vision is a tool that could provide livestock producers with digital body measures and records that are important for animal health and production, namely body height and length, and chest girth. However, to build these tools, the scarcity of labeled training data sets with uniform images (pose, lighting) that also represent real-world livestock can be a challenge. Collecting images in a standard way, with manual image labeling is the gold standard to create such training data, but the time and cost can be prohibitive. We introduce the PreciseEdge image segmentation algorithm to address these issues by employing a standard image collection protocol with a semi-automated image labeling method, and a highly precise image segmentation for automated body measurement extraction directly from each image. These elements, from image collection to extraction are designed to work together to yield values highly correlated to real-world body measurements. PreciseEdge adds a brief preprocessing step inspired by chromakey to a modified GrabCut procedure to generate image masks for data extraction (body measurements) directly from the images. Three hundred RGB (red, green, blue) image samples were collected uniformly per the African Goat Improvement Network Image Collection Protocol (AGIN-ICP), which prescribes camera distance, poses, a blue backdrop, and a custom AGIN-ICP calibration sign. Images were taken in natural settings outdoors and in barns under high and low light, using a Ricoh digital camera producing JPG images (converted to PNG prior to processing). The rear and side AGIN-ICP poses were used for this study. PreciseEdge and GrabCut image segmentation methods were compared for differences in user input required to segment the images. The initial bounding box image output was captured for visual comparison. Automated digital body measurements extracted were compared to manual measures for each method. Both methods allow additional optional refinement (mouse strokes) to aid the segmentation algorithm. These optional mouse strokes were captured automatically and compared. Stroke count distributions for both methods were not normally distributed per Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Non-parametric Wilcoxon tests showed the distributions were different (p< 0.001) and the GrabCut stroke count was significantly higher (p = 5.115 e-49), with a mean of 577.08 (std 248.45) versus 221.57 (std 149.45) with PreciseEdge. Digital body measures were highly correlated to manual height, length, and girth measures, (0.931, 0.943, 0.893) for PreciseEdge and (0.936, 0. 944, 0.869) for GrabCut (Pearson correlation coefficient). PreciseEdge image segmentation allowed for masks yielding accurate digital body measurements highly correlated to manual, real-world measurements with over 38% less user input for an efficient, reliable, non-invasive alternative to livestock hand-held direct measuring tools. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

	abstract = {Meat 4.0 refers to the application the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) technologies in the meat sector. Industry 4.0 components, such as robotics, Internet of Things, Big Data, augmented reality, cybersecurity, and blockchain, have recently transformed many industrial and manufacturing sectors, including agri-food sectors, such as the meat industry. The need for digitalised and automated solutions throughout the whole food supply chain has increased remarkably during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review will introduce the concept of Meat 4.0, highlight its main enablers, and provide an updated overview of recent developments and applications of Industry 4.0 innovations and advanced techniques in digital transformation and process automation of the meat industry. A particular focus will be put on the role of Meat 4.0 enablers in meat processing, preservation and analyses of quality, safety and authenticity. Our literature review shows that Industry 4.0 has significant potential to improve the way meat is processed, preserved, and analysed, reduce food waste and loss, develop safe meat products of high quality, and prevent meat fraud. Despite the current challenges, growing literature shows that the meat sector can be highly automated using smart technologies, such as robots and smart sensors based on spectroscopy and imaging technology. © 2022 by the authors.},

The prevailing enthusiasm and optimism about PLF innovations may be clouding the perception of possible threats that PLF may pose to farm animal welfare. Without claiming to be exhaustive, this paper lists 12 potential threats grouped into four categories: direct harm, indirect harm via the end-user, via changes to housing and management, and via ethical stagnation or degradation. PLF can directly harm the animals because of (1) technical failures, (2) harmful effects of exposure, adaptation or wearing of hardware components, (3) inaccurate predictions and decisions due to poor external validation, and (4) lack of uptake of the most meaningful indicators for animal welfare. PLF may create indirect effects on animal welfare if the farmer or stockperson (5) becomes under- or over-reliant on PLF technology, (6) spends less (quality) time with the animals, and (7) loses animal-oriented husbandry skills. PLF may also compromise the interests of the animals by creating transformations in animal farming so that the housing and management are (8) adapted to optimize PLF performance or (9) become more industrialized. Finally, PLF may affect the moral status of farm animals in society by leading to (10) increased speciesism, (11) further animal instrumentalization, and (12) increased animal consumption and harm. For the direct threats, possibilities for prevention and remedies are suggested. As the direction and magnitude of the more indirect threats are harder to predict or prevent, they are more difficult to address. In order to maximize the potential of PLF for improving animal welfare, the potential threats as well as the opportunities should be acknowledged, monitored and addressed.

	abstract = {Using autonomous meat cutting robots to cut porcine belly is a productive and more hygienic solution over traditional, labor-intensive meat cutting practices such as the transmission of the bacteria between the carcasses and manual laborers. Belly cutting is the first step of porcine meat segmentation. The robot needs to be precisely guided to cut open the porcine belly without damaging the guts inside, which facilitates subsequent processing of the guts. However, the body sizes of the pigs are different. As such, the 2-D and 3-D vision methods cannot be employed to identify the belly cutting path. In this article, a laser-guided efficient cutting path planning approach that combines the segmentation algorithm (SA) with an improved genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. The robotic cutting system consists of an industrial robotic manipulator, customized tools, a linear laser sensor, and a PC. The salient features of the proposed scheme are as follows: 1) Spatial relationships of all the relevant units are established in Cartesian space. 2) Using the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix, the porcine belly cutting path is recognized from the 3-D laser point cloud of the carcass. 3) Aiming at efficiently optimizing the discrete path waypoints, an adaptive elite GA (AEGA) is derived by improving three operators of GA. 4) In order to alleviate the robotic cutting errors, the SA is designed to shorten the cutting path with no damage to the guts. 5) Under the limit of the peritoneal cavity, the efficient robotic cutting path is optimized by combining the SA with AEGA. Porcine belly cutting experiments are carried out in a porcine automation line under real-world conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is accurate, efficient, and incurs lower costs in the long-term use of the robot.  © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There is a significant opportunity to improve profitability and productivity in pasture-based automatic milking systems (AMS). A decision-support system (DSS) is required for AMS that can integrate key mechanics of dynamic biological processes with farm economics. Here we developed and evaluated a web-based DSS named the Integrated Management Model (IMM) designed for assisting AMS farmers and their advisors to evaluate and improve the physical and economic performance of their businesses (https://bit.ly/MilkingEdgeAMSTool). The IMM comprises a series of empirically determined predictive equations derived from the main drivers of productivity and profitability in AMS, together with stochastic simulation and optimisation modelling. The equations and models in the IMM were developed using two data sources available through the Milking Edge project: (a) an annual physical and economic dataset collected from 14 AMS farms across Australia (from years 2015 to 2018), and (b) a monthly physical dataset from 23 AMS farms located across Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and Chile (years 2015 to 2019). Model predictions were evaluated using two similar datasets: (a) an annual physical and economic dataset from 11 Australian AMS farms (2018 to 2020) and a monthly physical dataset from 20 AMS from Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Argentina (2019 to 2020). The DSS was tested by 11 AMS farmers that provided feedback using the technology acceptance model framework. Results from the model evaluation showed the accuracy of the equations and simulations to predict physical variables such as milk harvested (kg milk/robot.d) or milking frequency (milkings/cow.d) was reasonably good (2–14% differences between observed and predicted values). The economic equations, which predicted operating profit margin (OP) (%) and return on total assets (ROTA) (%), could determine the relative changes and direction of profitability when physical variables change. However, the accuracy of these equations to estimate absolute values was low (ROTA: R2 0.26 and MAE 2.0%; OP: R2 0.36 and MAE 13.5%), probably due to the empirical nature of the equations and the relatively small number of farms involved in their development. Overall, farmers agreed that the IMM was a useful and easy-to-use DSS that can be used confidently to simulate physical scenarios and optimise the system performance. Whilst this DSS was designed for AMS farmers and farmers considering investing in AMS, future applications could include research, training, extension, teaching, consultancy or even innovation and development of new technology. © 2022},

In particular, the following components are suggested: (a) the determination of current deviations and interdependency between factors; (b) an algorithm for defining the possible sources of regulation; (c) the ranking approach of the optimal sequence of possible sources; and (d) ensuring transparency and coordination of the model with organic and energy certificates.

Since acquiring real-time data and performing manual analysis on those incidents are costly, we propose to leverage machine learning techniques to build an automated pipeline to construct an HWC knowledge base from historical news articles. Our unsupervised and active learning methods are not only able to recognize the major causes of HWC such as construction, pollution, and farming, but can also classify an unseen news article into its major cause with 90% accuracy. Moreover, our interactive visualizations of the knowledge base illustrate the spatial and temporal trend of human-wildlife conflicts across India for index by cities and animals. Based on our findings that most conflict zones include areas where human settlements are near forested areas, we extend our study to include satellite imagery to identify such proximity zones. We conduct a case study to use this method to identify human-elephant conflict hotspots in northern and western parts of the Indian state of West Bengal. We expect that our findings can inform the public of HWC hotspots and help in much more informed policymaking. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Background: As couples struggle with infertility and livestock producers wish to rapidly improve genetic merit in their herd, assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have become increasingly popular in human medicine as well as the livestock industry. Utilizing ART can cause an increased risk of congenital overgrowth syndromes, such as Large Offspring Syndrome (LOS) in ruminants. A dysregulation of transcripts has been observed in bovine fetuses with LOS, which is suggested to be a cause of the phenotype. Our recent study identified variations in tRNA expression in LOS individuals, leading us to hypothesize that variations in tRNA expression can influence the availability of their processed regulatory products, tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs). Due to their resemblance in size to microRNAs, studies suggest that tRFs target mRNA transcripts and regulate gene expression. Thus, we have sequenced small RNA isolated from skeletal muscle and liver of day 105 bovine fetuses to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to LOS. Moreover, we have utilized our previously generated tRNA sequencing data to analyze the contribution of tRNA availability to tRF abundance. Results: 22,289 and 7,737 unique tRFs were predicted in the liver and muscle tissue respectively. The greatest number of reads originated from 5′ tRFs in muscle and 5′ halves in liver. In addition, mitochondrial (MT) and nuclear derived tRF expression was tissue-specific with most MT-tRFs and nuclear tRFs derived from LysUUU and iMetCAU in muscle, and AsnGUU and GlyGCC in liver. Despite variation in tRF abundance within treatment groups, we identified differentially expressed (DE) tRFs across Control-AI, ART-Normal, and ART-LOS groups with the most DE tRFs between ART-Normal and ART-LOS groups. Many DE tRFs target transcripts enriched in pathways related to growth and development in the muscle and tumor development in the liver. Finally, we found positive correlation coefficients between tRNA availability and tRF expression in muscle (R = 0.47) and liver (0.6). Conclusion: Our results highlight the dysregulation of tRF expression and its regulatory roles in LOS. These tRFs were found to target both imprinted and non-imprinted genes in muscle as well as genes linked to tumor development in the liver. Furthermore, we found that tRNA transcription is a highly modulated event that plays a part in the biogenesis of tRFs. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between tRNA and tRF expression in combination with ART-induced LOS. Copyright © 2022 Goldkamp, Li, Rivera and Hagen.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to realize Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), i.e., no poverty, zero hunger, and sustainable cities and communities through the implementation of an intelligent cattle-monitoring system to enhance dairy production. Livestock industries in developing countries lack the technology that can directly impact meat and dairy products, where human resources are a major factor. This study proposed a novel, cost-effective, smart dairy-monitoring system by imple-menting intelligent wireless sensor nodes, the Internet of Things (IoT), and a Node-Micro controller Unit (Node-MCU). The proposed system comprises three modules, including an intelligent environmental parameter regularization system, a cow collar (equipped with a temperature sensor, a GPS module to locate the animal, and a stethoscope to update the heart rate), and an automatic water-filling unit for drinking water. Furthermore, a novel IoT-based front end has been developed to take data from prescribed modules and maintain a separate database for further analysis. The presented Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs) can intelligently determine the case of any instability in environmental parameters. Moreover, the cow collar is designed to obtain precise values of the tem-perature, heart rate, and accurate location of the animal. Additionally, auto-notification to the con-cerned party is a valuable addition developed in the cow collar design. It employed a plug-and-play design to provide ease in implementation. Moreover, automation reduces human intervention, hence labor costs are decreased when a farm has hundreds of animals. The proposed system also increases the production of dairy and meat products by improving animal health via the regulari-zation of the environment and automated food and watering. The current study represents a comprehensive comparative analysis of the proposed implementation with the existing systems that validate the novelty of this work. This implementation can be further stretched for other applica-tions, i.e., smart monitoring of zoo animals and poultry. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Livestock farming is assisted more and more by technological solutions, such as robots. One of the main problems for shepherds is the control and care of livestock in areas difficult to access where grazing animals are attacked by predators such as the Iberian wolf in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. In this paper, we propose a system to automatically generate benchmarks of animal images of different species from iNaturalist API, which is coupled with a vision-based module that allows us to automatically detect predators and distinguish them from other animals. We tested multiple existing object detection models to determine the best one in terms of efficiency and speed, as it is conceived for real-time environments. YOLOv5m achieves the best performance as it can process 64 FPS, achieving an mAP (with IoU of 50%) of 99.49% for a dataset where wolves (predator) or dogs (prey) have to be detected and distinguished. This result meets the requirements of pasture-based livestock farms. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Traceability was introduced about twenty years ago to face the worldwide spread of food safety crises. Traceability data flow associated with each lot of food products during any production and/or delivery phases can also be used to guarantee product authenticity. For this purpose, it is necessary to protect the data from cyber intrusions and, at the same time, to guarantee the integrity of the bond between the physical product and the data. Price grading related to quality perceivable or credence attributes attracts criminals to attempt item substitution fraud. Improved track and trace technologies supported by artificial intelligence (AI) could highly enhance systems’ capability to detect authenticity violations by product substitution. This paper proposes an innovative method based on AI, to reinforce traceability systems in detecting possible counterfeiting by product substitution. It is an item-based mass balance method that analyses the congruity of the traceability data flows not by using explicit (even stochastic) rules but by exploiting the learning capabilities of a neural network. The system can then detect sus-pect information in a traceability data flow, alerting a possible profit-driven crime. The AI-based method was applied to a pork slaughtering and meat cutting chain case study. © the Author(s), 2022.},

	abstract = {Precision livestock farming can combine sensors and complex data to provide a simple score of meaningful productivity, pig welfare, and farm sustainability, which are the main drivers of modern pig production. Examples include using infrared thermography to monitor the temperature of sows to detect the early stages of the disease. To take account of these drivers, we assigned 697 hybrid (BHZP db. Viktoria) sows to four parity groups. In addition, by pooling clinical findings from every sow and their piglets, sows were classified into three groups for the annotation: healthy, clinically suspicious, and diseased. Besides, the udder was thermographed, and performance data were documented. Results showed that the piglets of diseased sows with eighth or higher parity had the lowest daily weight gain [healthy; 192 g ± 31.2, clinically suspicious; 191 g ± 31.3, diseased; 148 g ± 50.3 (p < 0.05)] and the highest number of stillborn piglets (healthy; 2.2 ± 2.39, clinically suspicious; 2.0 ± 1.62, diseased; 3.91 ± 4.93). Moreover, all diseased sows showed higher maximal skin temperatures by infrared thermography of the udder (p < 0.05). Thus, thermography coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems can help identify and orient the diagnosis of symptomatic animals to prompt adequate reaction at the earliest time.

	abstract = {Livestock welfare assessment helps monitor animal health status to maintain productivity, identify injuries and stress, and avoid deterioration. It has also become an important marketing strategy since it increases consumer pressure for a more humane transformation in animal treatment. Common visual welfare practices by professionals and veterinarians may be subjective and cost-prohibitive, requiring trained personnel. Recent advances in remote sensing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence (AI) have helped developing new and emerging technologies for livestock biometrics to extract key physiological parameters associated with animal welfare. This review discusses the livestock farming digital transformation by describing (i) biometric techniques for health and welfare assessment, (ii) livestock identification for traceability and (iii) machine and deep learning application in livestock to address complex problems. This review also includes a critical assessment of these topics and research done so far, proposing future steps for the deployment of AI models in commercial farms. Most studies focused on model development without applications or deployment for the industry. Furthermore, reported biometric methods, accuracy, and machine learning approaches presented some inconsistencies that hinder validation. Therefore, it is required to develop more efficient, non-contact and reliable methods based on AI to assess livestock health, welfare, and productivity.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

	abstract = {The consumption of pork as a source of animal protein has increased worldwide, especially in developing countries such as South Africa. The increase in pork demand is putting pressure on the natural environment, and the costs of production are increasing. This study sought to determine what is the eco-efficiency of pork production in a South African context. It also was meant to determine which processes in the value chain have low eco-efficiencies. Lastly, it sought to find what strategies could be recommended to improve overall eco-efficiency. Eco-efficiency was assessed by following the requirements of the International Standards Organisation ISO 14045 standard, which requires that the Life cycle assessment (LCA) method and product system value be combined. The environmental life cycle costing (LCC) method was used to determine the product system value (Value Added) of pork production. The functional unit was 1 kg of pork carcass, specifically from the cradle to the abattoir gate. The findings indicated that the pig farm and abattoir were the processes that had low eco-efficiencies and eco-efficient strategic improvements could be made. Mitigation strategies could be developed to concentrate on the production of animal feed and the use of renewable energy sources at the abattoir. The use of water could be improved by automation of the abattoir processes. Therefore, this study achieved its goal as economic and environmental areas of interest were identified in this specific case study for South Africa. This framework could be extended to study the eco-efficiency of other meat production chains and other sectors. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

	abstract = {Good quality food is everyone’s priority in the current scenario as we have gone through a tough time in last 2 years because of pandemic. In India, agriculture has major impact on our economy. Agriculture is main resource to supply basic row materials necessary for industrialization and for need of mankind. In changing environment and technology, farming also need to be changed from traditional farming to smart farming. Most farmers are depending on farming as reliable source of livelihood for their families. Approximately two-third of working population depends on agriculture for their earning in rural area. Agriculture too plays an outstanding role in country growth. Potential input of farming to the growth in backcountry is providing enrollment, small upholding jobs depends on agriculture, etc. In the recent age, farmers from India also informed about latest trends new automations that helps authority to change traditional habit of planning into smart culture. The most common and powerful method of new days farming is adopting IOT. Internet of Things is network of connected physical devices like sensors, mobile, embedded systems and objects like people, smart tools through the medium of computer program applications. Data collection is done by the physical devices like sensors which get transferred to the “thing” mean people or object who can take an appropriate action based on received data. In this paper, we are presenting a detailed review on emerging techniques in irrigation based on IOT. We begin with basic idea of how IOT is useful in smart farming. We explore the different fields in farming, where IOT is applicable. Then, we review emerging IOT-based techniques used for drip irrigation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The motion behavior of dairy cows contains much of health information. The application of information and intelligent technology will help farms grasp the health status of dairy cows in time and improve breeding efficiency. In this paper, the development trend of intelligent morning technology of cow's motion behavior was mainly analyzed. Firstly, on the basis of expounding the significance of monitoring the basic motion (lying, walking, standing), oestrus, breathing, rumination and limping of dairy cows, the necessity of behavior monitoring of dairy cows was introduced. Secondly, the current research status was summarized from contact monitoring methods and non-contact monitoring methods in chronological order. The principle and achievements of related research were introduced in detail and classified. It is found that the current contact monitoring methods mainly rely on acceleration sensors, pedometers and pressure sensors, while the non-contact monitoring methods mainly rely on video images, including traditional video image analysis and video image analysis based on deep learning. Then, the development status of cow behavior monitoring industry was analyzed, and the main businesses and mainstream products of representative livestock farm automation equipment suppliers were listed. Industry giants, such as Afimilk and DeLaval, as well as their products such as intelligent collar (AfiCollar), pedometer (AfiActll Tag) and automatic milking equipment (VMS™ V300) were introduced. After that, the problems and challenges of current contact and non-contact monitoring methods of dairy cow motion behavior were put forward. The current intelligent monitoring methods of dairy cows' motion behavior are mainly wearable devices, but they have some disadvantages, such as bring stress to dairy cows and are difficult to install and maintain. Although the non-contact monitoring methods based on video image analysis technology does not bring stress to dairy cows and is low cost, the relevant research is still in its infancy, and there is still a certain distance from commercial use. Finally, the future development directions of relevant key technologies were prospected, including miniaturization and integration of wearable monitoring equipment, improving the robustness of computer vision technology, multi-target monitoring with limited equipment and promoting technology industrialization. © 2022 Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

	abstract = {Robotic herding is attracting attention as a new technology for managing grazing animals. As a preliminary step toward the application of robotic herding to the manipulation of grazing distribution, we investigated the behavioral responses of cattle to herding by an unmanned vehicle and its performance in manipulating grazing distribution in a pasture. A herd of approximately 30 cows was stocked in a 1.1-ha pasture for 5 days each month from May to October 2021. The cows were herded by a small unmanned ground vehicle for 7 days of the periods. The pasture was divided into nine plots, with one–four plots assigned as the herding area. When the cows grazed in the herding area, the operator maneuvered the vehicle using a transmitter to move them out of the area. The initial reaction (walk away, appear startled, appear interested, back away, or ignore) to the approaching vehicle, flight distance (within one cow-length or more), whether cows escaped from the vehicle or not, and escape gait (walk or run) were classified based on videos recorded during herding. The behavior and location of the cows were observed at 5 min intervals during the time in the pasture. Utilization rates (percentage of grazing time) of the plots were compared with those on days without herding. Throughout the survey, cows initially walked away from the approaching vehicle in 78% of the cases, the flight distance was within one cow-length in 89%, cows escaped from the vehicle in 93%, and when escaping, they walked in 91%. On the first day of herding, these occasions were less frequent (58%, 83%, 84%, and 82%, respectively), but increased on the second day and remained high thereafter. These findings suggest that cows were able to adjust to herding by an unmanned vehicle within a day and respond to the vehicle desirably for the manipulation of grazing distribution with little fear, irritation or discomfort. One-plot herding decreased the use of the herding area from 10.5% to 3.3% (P = 0.001). Two-plot herding decreased the use from 22.3% to 10.4% (P = 0.015) and increased the use of the least-utilized plot from 8.2% to 14.5% (P = 0.021). These findings indicate that robotic herding by an unmanned vehicle has the potential to positively manipulate grazing distribution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Poultry farming is an essential industry of animal husbandry, which is developing in the direction of scale, intelligence and unmanned. Intelligent information perception ideas for different application scenarios are stimulated with the rapid development of sensors, information communication and robotics technologies and artificial intelligence-based information processing technologies worldwide. Intelligent perception of information in the poultry farming process is important for the liberation of labor, safeguarding animal welfare, and improving the automation and efficiency of poultry farming. In this review, the information perception framework in modern poultry farming has been analyzed to fully illustrate the important role of information perception in modern poultry farming. In addition, we have reviewed the research of information perception technology in poultry farming in 26 countries around the world. According to the different research goals, it is mainly divided into five aspects: individual poultry target perception, behavior recognition, health and environmental monitoring, and breeding-related robots. Some tables are provided to summarize and review research information on different topics. We found that for the information perception in poultry breeding, many challenges still need to be solved, such as the accurate perception of poultry individual information in complex environment, multi-scale monitoring of poultry house environment, intelligent disease diagnosis and exception handling, robot function expansion and multi-robot coordination. To achieve the goal of accurate, efficient, and intelligent perception of information in the unmanned poultry farming system, we have also pointed out the future research focus and development trends respectively by combining the characteristics of different problems. © 2022},

	abstract = {Agriculture farms such as crop, aquaculture and livestock have begun the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in improving their productivity and product quality. However, microalgae farming which requires precise monitoring, controlling and predicting the growth of microalgae biomass has yet to incorporate with IoT and AI technology, as it is still in its infancy phase. Particularly, the cultivation stage of microalgae involves many essential parameters (i.e. biomass concentration, pH, light intensity, temperature and tank level) which require precise monitoring as these parameters are important to ensure an effective biomass productivity in the microalgae farming. Besides, the conventional practices in the current process equipment are still powered by electricity, thus further development by integrating IoT into these processes can ease the production process. Further to that, many researchers has studied the machine learning approach for the identification and classification of microalgae. However, there are still limited studies reported on applying machine learning for the application of microalgae industry such as optimising microalgae cultivation for higher biomass productivity. Therefore, the implementation of IoT and AI in microalgae farming can contribute to the development of the global microalgae industry. The purpose of this current review paper focuses on the overview microalgae biomass production process along with the implementation of IoT toward the future of smart farming. To bridge the gap between the conventional and microalgae smart farming, this paper also highlights the insights on the implementation phases of microalgae smart farming starting from the infant stage that involves the installation and programming of IoT hardware. Then, it is followed by the application of machine learning to predict and auto-optimise the microalgae smart farming process. Furthermore, the process setup and detailed overview of microalgae farming with the integration of IoT have been discussed critically. This review paper would provide a new vision of microalgae farming for microalgae researchers and bio-processing industries into the digitalisation industrial era. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Progressive development of the dairy industry requires improving technologies of feed production, keeping, feeding, increasing livestock and breeding work on farms, the genetic potential of breeds, milking cows, storing and processing milk and producing the necessary range of dairy products. Successful implementation of these technological processes requires an effective system of innovative support for dairy production, for which the scientific developments of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine are important. At the same time, the ability of dairy enterprises to innovative development is determined by the transformation of their economic mechanism through the introduction of technical, organisational and managerial achievements in the field of technology. The purpose of the article is to study the current realities, opportunities and forecast the main dimensions for the intensification of innovative activities of dairy enterprises in Ukraine. A number of methods were used in the research process: monographic; comparative analysis; prognostication; tabular; settlement and constructive; graphic, abstract-logical. The existence of an adapted system of innovative support is established and scientific developments of control in the selection of raw milk, vitamin naturalisation of milk, technologies of production of dietary dairy products, automation of production processes, heat treatment of milk using modern packaging materials to extend its shelf life, introduction of innovative methods in operational activities, personnel development, marketing and logistics, the use of which should be extended in the system of economic mechanism of functioning and development of the dairy industry. The forecast indicators of the raw material base of the dairy industry of Ukraine, which in 2025 will remain at the level of 2020 and will amount to 9287 thousand tons, with an increase in milk production in agricultural enterprises by 13.0% and a decrease in households by 5.0%. The necessary volumes of raw material production have been established to ensure the production capacity of milk processing enterprises and the rational norm of consumption of milk and dairy products. The dynamics of forecast indicators of dairy production in Ukraine is constructed. The priority target guidelines of the strategy of intensification of innovative activity of milk processing enterprises are substantiated. An algorithm for increasing the innovative activity of a processing enterprise is proposed. These approaches and research results can be used by public and sectoral authorities in the organization of monitoring and development of priority measures to intensify the innovative activities of Ukrainian dairy industry. © 2022, National Scientific Centre Institute of Agrarian Economics.

The frozen AI in sheep is, to date, not fulfilling the farmer’s need. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the pregnancy rate in indigenous ewes with chilled semen preserved at different hours. Methods: Semen was collected from three indigenous rams using an artificial vagina and evaluated for its quality both in the fresh and chilled stage at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h before insemination. Trans-cervical insemination was performed in PGF2α synchronized ewes. Pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasonography at 50-60 days of gestation. Result: The motility, viability and normal sperm values of chilled semen decreased significantly (p<0.01) with increasing the duration of preservation. However, the quality of chilled semen was acceptable level for insemination. The pregnancy rate was significantly varied (p<0.01) and the higher pregnancy rate (64.28%) was achieved when AI was performed using semen stored at 4∘C for 12 h than 24 h (58.33%) and 48 h (50%), respectively. Therefore, increased the duration of preservation time of different chilling process negatively affect the semen quality and the pregnancy rates. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {Automatic identification and sorting of livestock organs in the meat processing industry could reduce costs and improve efficiency. Two hyperspectral sensors encompassing the visible (400–900 nm) and short-wave infrared (900–1700 nm) spectra were used to identify the organs by type. A total of 104 parenchymatous organs of cattle and sheep (heart, kidney, liver, and lung) were scanned in a multi-sensory system that encompassed both sensors along a conveyor belt. Spectral data were obtained and averaged following manual markup of three to eight regions of interest of each organ. Two methods were evaluated to classify organs: Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and random forest (RF). In addition, classification models were obtained with the smoothed reflectance and absorbance and the first and second derivatives of the spectra to assess if one was superior to the rest. The in-sample accuracy for the visible, short-wave infrared, and combination of both sensors was higher for PLS-DA compared to RF. The accuracy of the classification models was not significantly different between data pre-processing methods or between visible and short-wave infrared sensors. Hyperspectral sensors, particularly those in the visible spectrum, seem promising to identify organs from slaughtered animals which could be useful for the automation of quality and process control in the food supply chain, such as in abattoirs. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Precision technology devices can measure and detect relative changes in an animal's behavior to possibly create alerts to intervene and to administer treatments. However, the association of relative changes in daily feeding and activity behaviors in calves with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) status is still largely unexplored. The objective of this case-control study was to determine if daily behavioral patterns of preweaning dairy calves (measured by precision technologies) change before BRD diagnosis. This case-control study enrolled 33 pairs of calves (33 BRD calves matched by age, sex, and birthdate to 33 controls) health scored daily for BRD for the preweaning period (until 50 d on the automated feeder). A pedometer (IceQube, Ice Robotics) was attached to the left rear leg to track activity (lying time, lying bouts, total steps, and acceleration activity index). At 3.0 ± 2.0 d of age, calves were trained to use the automated feeder, which recorded milk and calf starter intake, drinking speed, and feeder visits. Calves were allotted a maximum 10 L/d of milk replacer (Cow's Match, Land O'Lakes Animal Milk Products Co.; 140 g/L) and starter (Special Calf Starter and Grower, Baghdad Feeds), ad libitum. Calves were scored daily for signs of BRD using the Wisconsin scoring system, and their lungs were scored with ultrasonography twice weekly. Outward signs of BRD as defined by the Wisconsin scoring system and an area of consolidated lung ≥3.0 cm2 was identified as BRD (d 0). Relative changes in daily behaviors were calculated using d −5 before BRD diagnosis as the baseline for each calf for each behavior. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the association of BRD status with feeding behaviors, activity, and relative changes in calf behavior over a 5-d period before diagnosis, as well as the BRD status × day interaction. Calves with a BRD bout were diagnosed at an average age of 33.0 ± 9.0 d (mean ± standard deviation) and weighed 56.1 ± 9.7 kg. Over the period, BRD calves had reduced milk and starter intake, greater lying times, and fewer lying bouts, step counts, and activity indices when compared with healthy calves. Furthermore, there was a BRD status × day interaction for relative changes in unrewarded visits, and relative changes in calf starter intake. Specifically, BRD calves had a decline in relative changes in their unrewarded visits on d −4, −2, −1, and 0 compared with healthy calves. This study suggests that there is the potential to use feeding and activity behaviors to identify BRD development in preweaning calves. However, utilization of an animals' daily behavioral patterns in real time is fundamental for developing disease detection algorithms, thus we suggest relative changes in unrewarded visits may be useful for algorithm development when d −5 is used as a baseline. Future research should investigate the potential of feeding behavior and activity levels collectively to indicate BRD status in calves using machine learning techniques. © 2022 American Dairy Science Association},

	abstract = {Background and Aim: Pig farming is integral in developing Kazakhstan's animal husbandry as it has shown rapid growth in profit and a high turnover. Industrial pig products have significant global demand, particularly in China and Russia. However, as pig farming is a small-scale industry with insufficient mechanization and automation in Kazakhstan, the costs have increased while the quality of Kazakhstani pig products has decreased due to the simultaneous influx of cheap imported pork into the domestic market. This study aimed to analyze the export potential of the swine industry in the Republic of Kazakhstan and assess its impact on the global pork market. Materials and Methods: A meta-analysis of open sources was conducted for the period 1990-2020, while forecasting was extended to 2025. Statistical methods for the analysis (construction of time series with equal intervals, calculation, interpretation of average values, and growth rates) were used. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to study the dependence of the productivity of pigs on the category of the pig farming enterprise to establish the relationship between the average live weight of one head of pigs and the share of pigs in agricultural enterprises in the total number of pigs. The polynomial smoothing method was used, and a trend line was built, forecasting the number of pigs in Kazakhstan, the production and sale of pig products, along with their cost and profitability. Results: This study briefly characterizes the developing situation of the global pork market. We identified and evaluated the development trends in Kazakh pig farming in terms of their impact on the industry's export potential. Specifically, we determined the following trends: An increase in the actual and projected number of pigs; a decrease in the natural loss of pigs during 2014-2020; the growth of existing and forecast indicators of pork sales in the domestic market; a steady decrease in the share of pigs in small households and an increase in the share of pigs in peasant farms and agricultural enterprises; an increase in the dynamics of the productivity of the pig population; and the growth of actual and predicted profitability of production and sale of pig products. We discussed the main problems that hinder the entry of Kazakhstani pork into the global market: Small-scale farming, insufficient mechanization and automation, and inadequate financial support from the state and banking structures. First, small-scale farming (deduced from the number of pigs by the farm categories) has hampered the small farms' independent manufacture and use of feed grain (i.e., barley, which is abundant in Kazakhstan), which might reduce costs. Moreover, small-scale farms struggle to comply with the waste disposal rules for pig production and environmental safety norms, which limit the export potential of Kazakhstani pork. Second, insufficient mechanization and automation in feeding and breeding (i.e., use of resource-saving technologies) result in inadequate productivity, decreased competitiveness, and failure to meet global standards. Third, insufficient financial support in the form of grants allocated to purposes other than selection and breeding limits the overall development of Kazakhstani pig farming. Conclusion: The positive dynamics of the main development indicators of Kazakhstani pig farming efficiently assess the industry's export potential, according to the country's leading academic specialists and practitioners in the agricultural sector, especially in light of the difficult epizootic situation. This provides abundant opportunities for export supplies in the global meat market. These indicators include the number of pigs, its natural decline, and structure by farm categories. They also include the production, sale, and profitability of production of pig products and the productivity of pigs. As China and Russia currently have a massive shortage of this product in the domestic markets, they are potential importers of Kazakh pork. Copyright: © Dambaulova, et al. Open Access.},

	abstract = {On dairy farms with a small number of livestock, it is not always profitable to use expensive high-performance machines and equipment. Here, it is more rational to use easy-to-maintain means of small mechanization, which significantly facilitate the work of the farmer, requiring low operating costs. milk production, in turn, is closely related to the method of keeping livestock. This method is a non-binding box method, in which, as domestic and foreign experience shows, labor costs are reduced several times. A significant increase in labor productivity in dairy cattle breeding provides, first of all, the development and implementation of advanced technologies in practice. Machine milking facilitates the work of operators and increases productivity, allows you to get clean, high-quality milk at a low cost. During milking cows, the service personnel must constantly monitor the process, do not miss its completion, turn off and remove the milking machine in time. Overexposure of it on the udder nipples after the end of milk excretion causes pain in the cow, a decrease in milk output, increases the duration of milking, leads to injury to the nipples, initiates mastitis disease. Technologies of industrial milk production the equipment used does not fully meet the zootechnical requirements for productivity, energy and metal consumption, reliability. Serial equipment is structurally difficult, the complexity of maintenance of automation tools for machine milking processes is great. The study of the technological process of machine milking shows that labor productivity at all milking plants depends primarily on the duration of manual operations and the time of milking cows. The article describes the automation of the milking process.  © 2022 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

The aims of this scientific note were to address the recent progress and the challenges specifically in the research of BSFL rearing using locally available organic waste as feedstock. It has been found that the pre-treatment of feedstock with blending and fermentation methods increases nutrient content and palatability. Studies examining bioconversion of feedstock, growth performance and protein production of BSFL are highlighted. Moving towards Industry 4.0, the Internet of Things (IoT) and automated smart farming systems have been proposed and implemented recently to establish a sustainable agriculture system in BSFL rearing industry. Notwithstanding, much work is still required on the post-harvest processing techniques and the application of advanced technologies to standardize BSFL protein quality. The resolution of industrialization challenges will comprehend the sustainable production and the potential applications of BSFL protein. © 2022, African Association of Insect Scientists.},

The research aims to study the changes in heaviness and intensity of work of agricultural workers as a result of introduction of digital technologies. As research methods, the workplace of a robotic milking operator was assessed in comparison with a machine milking operator. And 7 indicators belong to class 1 and 6 indicators to the second class of the working conditions, therefore, a general assessment of work heaviness corresponds to the class "Acceptable"(class 2). The assessment of work intensity revealed 7 indicators that belong to class 3.1 (stressful work of the first degree) and 3 indicators to class 3.2 (stressful work of the second degree). This allows making a conclusion that a general assessment of work intensity of a robotic milking operator corresponds to the class of stressful work of second degree. The use of robotic milking can be recommended to reduce the loads for livestock workers. At the same time, attention should be paid to reducing the work intensity of robotic milking operators. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Giardia duodenalis is the most common intestinal protozoan in humans and animals worldwide, including eight morphologically identical assemblages, infecting pets, livestock, wildlife and human beings. Assemblages A and B are those with the higher zoonotic potential, and they have been detected in several mammals other than humans; the others (C to H) show a higher host specificity. Cats can harbour both the specific Assemblage F and the zoonotic ones A and B. Several studies have been carried out on G. duodenalis genotypes in cats; however, the role of this species in the epidemiology of giardiasis is still poorly understood. In this scenario, the present study carried out the detection and genetic characterization at sub-assemblage level of G. duodenalis from colony stray cats in central Italy. In the period 2018–2019, 133 cat faecal samples were analysed for the presence of G. duodenalis cysts by a direct immunofluorescence assay. Positive samples were subsequently subjected to molecular analyses for assemblage/sub-assemblage identification. Forty-seven samples (35.3%) were positive for G. duodenalis cysts by immunofluorescence. G. duodenalis DNA was amplified at SSU-rDNA locus from 39 isolates: 37 were positive for zoonotic Assemblage A and 2 showed a mixed infection (A + B). Positive results for the β-giardin gene were achieved for 25 isolates. Sequence analysis revealed 16 isolates belonging to Sub-assemblage AII and 8 to Sub-assemblage AIII. One isolate resulted as ambiguous AI/AIII. Large sequence variability at the sub-assemblage level was detected, with several double peaks and mutations, making complex a proper isolate allocation. When compared with previous studies, the 35.3% prevalence of G. duodenalis in cats reported in the present article was surprisingly high. Moreover, all positive cats resulted to be infected with zoonotic assemblages/sub-assemblages, thus indicating stray cats as a possible source of human giardiasis and highlighting the sanitary relevance of cat colonies in the study area. © 2021 The Authors.

Assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs) ranging from artificial insemination (AI) to advanced genome editing have been used to enhance production and value addition of the livestock products. Harnessing female reproduction potential is target of animal reproduction biotechnologists and animal breeders. Single ovulation embryo transfer (SOET) and multiple ovulation embryo transfer (MOET) are the methods to produce embryos to achieve more progenies from superior females. The processe(s) involve drug-induced superovulation that results in release of multiple oocytes from a donor as opposed to release of single or sometimes two oocytes under natural reproductive cycle. MOET has been used in many livestock species including cattle, buffaloes, equines, camels, pigs, sheep, and goats. This chapter summarizes a perspective on pursuit of MOET in domesticated large animals with emphasis on water buffaloes, the leading livestock contributing to high quality milk and meat in South-East Asia and Mediterranean countries. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

The ubiquity of these technological solutions has enabled stakeholders to create more robust agricultural supply chains, that deliver sustainable nutrition for a growing population. However, the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is responsible for many of the current breakthroughs in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) and agriculture in general, has meant that modern decision-support solutions have increasingly transitioned toward black box systems. It has become apparent that a gap exists between efforts to develop more advanced machine learning models, and the growing demands for ethical assessment and transparency in agriculture decision-making. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is one such solution that could prove effective in overcoming the current limitations of black-box models, by allowing the decision-making process of such models to be explored. Through a literature review, we evaluate the potential of XAI in various agricultural use cases and demonstrate the potential benefits of its application to precision livestock management. © ECPLF 2022.

	abstract = {The IoT is a new technology trend used in almost every area thing, when connected to the internet and to each other, when you connect to the internet or interconnect, your entire system will be smarter. We have used IoT in all areas of our lives, including smart cities, smart homes, and smart retail. Much more. From 9.6 billion by 2050, agriculture needs to deliver even faster to meet this type of demand. This is possible with the latest technology, especially the IoT. The IoT enables labour free farms. Not only can it be used for large-scale agriculture, but it can also be used for livestock, greenhouse management, and agricultural land management. The most significant tool for the IoT is the sensor. A sensor is a device that collects important data that is interpreted to obtain the required analysis. The important objective of sensors are used to determine the soil's physical qualities and the environment. The main applications of sensors are control and supervise, safety, alarm, diagnostics, and analytics. Sensors make innovative agriculture more effective and trouble-free. In agriculture, the sensor is mainly used for measuring, measuring NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels, and detecting disease and soil moisture content. The main solution to this problem is smart farming, which modernizes traditional farming practices. This paper narrates the role of IoT application in smart agriculture. Smart farming is also known as precision farming hence it uses accurate information to draw outcomes. It demonstrates the different sensors, applications, challenges, strengths and weaknesses that support the IoT and agriculture. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) is a reproductive technology to increase the livestock population in a short period. The success of ovary stimulation programs is influenced by an individual's response to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation. In this study embryo production was carried out on local cows represented by Peranakan Ongole (PO) cows and exotic cows represented by Simmental cows. FSH stimulation was performed on 10 PO cows and 10 Simmental cows. On Day-1 Cue Mate® (progesterone) was inserted intravaginally. FSH injection (400 mg) was carried out intramuscularly from D-10 at reduced dose with 12 hours intervals (Day-10: 100 mg; Day-11: 60 mg; Day-12: 40 mg per injection). On Day-12, prostaglandin (PGF2α) was injected and Cue Mate® was removed. Artificial insemination (AI) was performed 48 hours after PGF2α injection for 3 times at 12 hours intervals. The embryo was collected 6 days after the last AI (Day-21). Superovulation response was detected on 70% of PO cows and 90% of Simmental cows. The average number of transferable embryos in Simmental cows (9.11 7.27) was higher than PO cows (7.86 7.78). This research shows that Simmental cows are more responsive to FSH stimulation, and can produce more transferable embryos than PO cows. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Success in the global fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is likely to improve if surveillance can be performed on an epidemiological scale. An approach based on agars with incorporated antimicrobials has enormous potential to achieve this. However, there is a need to identify the combinations of selective agars and key antimicrobials yielding the most accurate counts of susceptible and resistant organisms. A series of experiments involving 1,202 plates identified the best candidate combinations from six commercially available agars and five antimicrobials, using 18 Escherichia coli strains as either pure cultures or inocula-spiked feces. The effects of various design factors on colony counts were analyzed in generalized linear models. Without antimicrobials, Brilliance E. coli and CHROMagar ECC agars yielded 28.9% and 23.5% more colonies, respectively, than MacConkey agar. The order of superiority of agars remained unchanged when fecal samples with or without spiking of resistant E. coli strains were inoculated onto agars with or without specific antimicrobials. When antimicrobials were incorporated at various concentrations, it was revealed that ampicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin were suitable for incorporation into Brilliance and CHROMagar agars at all defined concentrations. Gentamicin was suitable for incorporation only at 8 and 16 mg/ml, while ceftiofur was suitable only at 1 mg/ml. CHROMagar extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) agar supported growth of a wider diversity of extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant E. coli strains. The findings demonstrate the potential for agars with incorporated antimicrobials to be combined with laboratory-based robotics to deliver AMR surveillance on a vast scale with greater sensitivity of detection and strategic relevance. IMPORTANCE Established models of surveillance for AMR in livestock typically have a low sampling intensity, which creates a tremendous barrier to understanding the variation of resistance among animal and food enterprises. However, developments in laboratory robotics now make it possible to rapidly and affordably process large volumes of samples. Combined with modern selective agars incorporating antimicrobials, this forms the basis of a novel surveillance process for identifying resistant bacteria by chromogenic reactions, including accurately detecting and quantifying the presence of bacteria even when they are present at low concentrations. Because Escherichia coli is a widely preferred indicator bacterium for AMR surveillance, this study identifies the optimal selective agar for quantifying resistant E. coli strains by assessing the growth performance on agars with antimicrobials. The findings are the first step toward exploiting laboratory robotics in an up-scaled approach to AMR surveillance in livestock, with wider adaptations in food, clinical microbiology, and public health.

This involves the framework of various sensors and software in the form of an embedded system to perform either a single or multiple tasks simultaneously. IoT is a continuously building network of smart sensors and devices that are connected to the internet. However, the connected IoT devices require a huge amount of energy for high and efficient performance to provide a sophisticated environment to the users. This had become a huge concern and gained a huge focus on the upcoming research providing a pathway for the G-IoT, i.e., Green IoT. G-IoT represents the framework of connecting smart sensors and devices and creating automation by enabling energy conservation methods. Cloud Computing and Machine Learning techniques like Artificial Neural Networks, C-Means, K-Means, and Bayesian Model are used for creating IoT systems that are cost-effective and has low-power consumption. Energy consumption depends upon the system architecture and its requirements. The approaches like Green Computing and Green Wireless Sensor Networks make difference in the energy consumption criteria. G-IoT has many applications in agriculture, namely, smart agribots, machine navigation, harvesting robots, smart farming kits, material handling, agricultural drones, remote sensing for crop and weather conditions, monitoring and sensing soil quality, computer imaging techniques for quality control, sorting, and grading, and irrigation monitoring. Moreover, Machine Learning had become an emerging paradigm and the tools or models are quite widely used in various applications.

Animal proximity to the robot, the number of animals that came into contact with the robot, and the frequency of contact with the teleoperated robot platform were recorded. The animal behavior data suggests that cows tend to flee at a regular distance when approached, while horses flee inconsistent distances. Horses showed a higher rate of interaction with the robot. Both species tended to interact with a stationary robot compared to a moving one. Outside of these trends, animal behavior was highly variable and suggests a need to design autonomous robot behaviors/algorithms in which robots should treat pasture inhabitants as unpredictable, but suggests that an autonomous pasture maintenance robot can operate in an occupied pasture. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Robots and complex robotic systems are appearing in more and more industrial and professional service applications. However, while mechanical components and control systems are advancing rapidly, the legislation background and standards framework for such systems and machinery are lagging behind. As part of a fundamental research work targeting industrial robots and industry 4.0 solutions for completely automated slaughtering, it was revealed that there are no particular standards addressing robotics systems applied to the agri-food domain. More specifically, within the agri-food sector, the only standards existing for the meat industry and the red meat sector are hygienic standards related to machinery. None of the identified standards or regulations consider the safety of autonomous robot operations or human–robot collaborations in the abattoirs. The goal of this paper is to provide a general overview of the regulations and standards (and similar guiding documents) relevant for such applications, that could possibly be used as guidelines during the development of inherently safe robotic systems for abattoirs. Reviewing and summarizing the relevant standard and legislation landscape should also of-fer some instrumental help regarding the foreseen certification procedure of meat processing robots and robot cells for slaughterhouses in the near future. © 2022, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

This review not only highlights the effective use of AI at different layers of a smart agriculture architecture but also identifies future research directions in this field. We found that the deep learning algorithms that have been used in recent studies have performed far better than the conventional machine learning algorithms due to recent technological advances that can efficiently process vast amount of data and enable timely intelligent decisions similar to human decisions.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Precision livestock farming has become an important research focus with the rising demand of meat production in the swine industry. Currently, the farming practice is widely conducted by the technology of computer vision (CV), which automates monitoring pig activity solely based on video recordings. Automation is fulfilled by deriving imagery features that can guide CV systems to recognize animals' body contours, positions, and behavioral categories. Nevertheless, the performance of the CV systems is sensitive to the quality of imagery features. When the CV system is deployed in a variable environment, its performance may decrease as the features are not generalized enough under different illumination conditions. Moreover, most CV systems are established by supervised learning, in which intensive effort in labeling ground truths for the training process is required. Hence, a semi-supervised pipeline, VTag, is developed in this study. The pipeline focuses on long-term tracking of pig activity without requesting any pre-labeled video but a few human supervisions to build a CV system. The pipeline can be rapidly deployed as only one top-view RGB camera is needed for the tracking task. Additionally, the pipeline was released as a software tool with a friendly graphical interface available to general users. Among the presented datasets, the average tracking error was 17.99 cm. Besides, with the prediction results, the pig moving distance per unit time can be estimated for activity studies. Finally, as the motion is monitored, a heat map showing spatial hot spots visited by the pigs can be useful guidance for farming management. The presented pipeline saves massive laborious work in preparing training dataset. The rapid deployment of the tracking system paves the way for pig behavior monitoring. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Patterns in pigs activity can be an indicator of health and welfare of the animals. This motivates researchers to develop Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) tools for automated monitoring of pig activity level. In this research we compared two important technologies that can be used for this purpose, ear tag accelerometer and computer vision. Additionally, we compared both technologies with gold standard based on human labelling. A state-of-the-art object detection algorithm RetinaNet was trained on 9969 images and validated on 4273 images to automatically detect head of a sow, body of a sow, left ear, right ear and a hay rack. It was possible to detect these objects with a performance of 0.26 mAP@0.5:0.95. Activity of 6 sows was derived from detected parts of animals’ bodies and compared with activity measurement based on ear tag accelerometer data. Dynamic relation between activity measurement based on both technologies was modelled with Transfer Function (TF) models. For all 6 animals activity of the body of a sow based on object detection was very similar to accelerometer based activity measurement (R2 > 0.7). Similarly R2 between activity of a head of a sow and accelerometer based activity was also very similar for most sows (R2 > 0.7). Results of fitting of TF models to animal activity data based on ear tag accelerometer and output of object detection on body of sows and head of sows suggests that both technologies, the accelerometer and computer vision provide very similar information on activity level of animals. The presented computer vision method is limited to monitoring one animal under camera view as detected body parts cannot be associated with multiple individuals. Moreover, we expect that the method requires re-training the RetinaNet object detection algorithm with additional images collected on additional farms to achieve satisfactory performance in different environments. Application of computer vision approach might be advantageous in some PLF applications as it is non-invasive and might be less laborious than method based on ear tag accelerometer data. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {In the pig industry, the social behaviors of preweaning piglets are critical indicators of their liveability, growth, health, and welfare status. In this study, we developed a novel method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that extracts high-quality spatiotemporal features to detect different types of social behaviors among preweaning piglets: snout-snout and snout-body social nosing, and snout-snout and snout-body aggressive/playing behavior. In our method, piglets were first detected and individually tracked using an integrated CNN-based network. Upon piglet detection, the key points of the piglet body were detected using a key point detector and a 1-second-tracking-unit strategy was adopted to reduce the influence of tracking errors and missing the detection of piglets. To detect suspected social behaviors in a tracking unit, we constructed a self-adaptive spatial affinity kernel function to represent the relationships between piglets, and pairwise piglets with spatial affinity higher than 0.7 were kept for further analysis, while the others were filtered out. Thereafter, high-quality spatiotemporal features consisting of the piglets’ spatial affinity and the corresponding linear motion and angular motion intensities were extracted and input into a support vector machine to hierarchically detect and classify piglet social behaviors. In addition, the proportions of the four detected social behaviors associated with the interaction points were analyzed in short video clips and a long video that covered the whole daytime. Our method achieved a favorable detection performance with a recall of 0.9687, a precision of 0.9309, and an F1 of 0.9494 in the short video clips, and a recall of 0.9576, a precision of 0.9187, and an F1 of 0.9377 in the 8-h long video episode. This shows the feasibility of the detection of social behaviors for piglets using CNNs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The alternative stable state (ASS) theory provides a plausible framework to explain the spatial distribution of biomes and their dynamics. Existing studies to test the alternative biome states (ABSs) mainly focused on tree-dominated biomes. It is still uncertain whether ABSs are present in a wide range of terrestrial biomes. This study was to examine the ABSs in the terrestrial vegetated areas of Africa and the maintaining factors. The potential landscapes were reconstructed separately for forest, grassland and shrubland using the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field data along the gradients of temperature, precipitation and aridity index (AI, the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration). The differences of soil organic carbon density (SOCD), fire count and grazing intensity were compared to test the feedback hypothesis to maintain the ABSs. The results showed that AI performed well in detecting the ABSs at the continental scale of Africa. Forest (at the wetter end) and shrubland (at the drier end) were well separated along the AI axis. Forest had three stable states (i.e. closed forest, woody savanna, and savanna) and shrubland had two stable states (i.e. closed shrubland and open shrubland). Grassland had two stable states (i.e. dense grassland and sparse grassland) distributing in a large AI range. The stable states that shared a specific AI range were regarded as the ABSs. Climate aridity greatly determined the distribution of the ABSs but the positive feedbacks between vegetation and SOCD, fire count, and livestock density played potential roles in driving the shifts between the ABSs. Our study indicated that the ABSs commonly existed in varied biomes (both tree-dominated and non-tree-dominated) in the African continent, which provided an enlarged picture of the ABSs of the terrestrial biomes. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of large scale vegetation patterns and their dynamics and facilitate to macro management of the terrestrial ecosystems in facing the possible regime shifts of the biomes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

However, few frameworks consider the specific aspects of the agri-food value chains. Also, none of the available frameworks meets the requirements of these value chains. This chapter will thoroughly describe this value chain considering its main stages, stakeholders, processes, and the informational flow. In sequence, the requirements and services needed for implementing IoT are described, containing nine main services and 31 sub-services or activities. Then, a domain model based on the IoT-A framework is developed. The model comprises the main users, physical entities and services for the beef cattle domain, and their interaction and information exchange. The main components of this domain model are described, and important topics related to the implementation are discussed. The methodology used and the analysis conducted can be applied to other agricultural value chains. This work sets the ground requirements for the future development of a framework for Smart Beef Cattle Services. These can also be used for developing a more general Smart Livestock Farming framework. Farm management research may benefit from the resulting requirements, using it to build services and architectures for a panorama of further automation and autonomous operations of the farms and agricultural supply chains. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Innovations related to animal care in livestock production increasingly rely on the automation of management procedures utilizing machines and robots. However, current solutions incorporate animals mainly passively, e.g. by measuring their health status and predicting their behavior. This approach neglects that animals are able to signal their needs actively and can thus provide information about their environment and cooperate in management tasks. The key to unlock this potential is to establish bidirectional communication between animals and machines. This can be achieved by automatically condition animals to show stimulus-controlled operant behavior. However, this automation of animal learning requires metrics for the learning progress that are applicable in a variety of contexts. We show that the current learning metrics are not transferable in this regard and propose a normalized precision metric as an alternative. This metric was utilized to analyze the learning performance of adult sows in an exemplary signal discrimination task, set in three fundamentally different training conditions. The results demonstrate that the normalized precision metric is unaffected by differences in the distribution of learned events. Moreover, it fulfills basic plausibility criteria for the assessment of animal learning that are not satisfied by other metrics, such as comparable start and end values under different conditions. This provides the precondition for a broader utilization of cooperative livestock farming - a new form of integrating animals in management tasks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

With a focus on the meat processing sector, this paper considers the short, medium, and potential long-term implications of the pandemic for food supply chains. A series of short-run demand and supply shocks affected the food system. The pandemic has generated a lively discourse around the adaptability and resilience of food supply chains in the medium to longer term. Scale and scope economies in meat processing offer significant cost and efficiency advantages, while a more dispersed industry structure can be more flexible. The pandemic is likely to accelerate the adoption of automation and digitalization within food supply chains. The Covid-19 pandemic also focused consumer attention on the food system and the nature of food supply chains. Consumers' underlying food values may shape their response to uncertainty during a pandemic.

Sensor technology enables the automatic and continuous monitoring of calf physiology or behavior, potentially offering timely and precise detection of sick calves. A systematic overview of automated disease detection in calves is still lacking. The objectives of this literature review were hence: to investigate previously applied sensor validation methods used in the context of calf health, to identify sensors used on calves, the parameters these sensors monitor, and the statistical tools applied to identify diseases, to explore potential research gaps and to point to future research opportunities. To achieve these objectives, systematic literature searches were conducted. We defined four stages in the development of health-monitoring systems: (1) sensor technique, (2) data interpretation, (3) information integration, and (4) decision support. Fifty-four articles were included (stage one: 26; stage two: 19; stage three: 9; and stage four: 0). Common parameters that assess the performance of these systems are sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and negative predictive value. Gold standards that typically assess these parameters include manual measurement and manual health-assessment protocols. At stage one, automatic feeding stations, accelerometers, infrared thermography cameras, microphones, and 3-D cameras are accurate in screening behavior and physiology in calves. At stage two, changes in feeding behaviors, lying, activity, or body temperature corresponded to changes in health status, and point to health issues earlier than manual health checks. At stage three, accelerometers, thermometers, and automatic feeding stations have been integrated into one system that was shown to be able to successfully detect diseases in calves, including BRD and NCD. We discuss these findings, look into potentials at stage four, and touch upon the topic of resilience, whereby health-monitoring system might be used to detect low resilience (i.e., prone to disease but clinically healthy calves), promoting further improvements in calf health and welfare.

	abstract = {In recent years the use of wearable sensors has proved to be valid tools in the field of livestock farming. They have played a crucial role in the automation and evolution of animal health and welfare monitoring processes, especially in the case of extensive farms where there is an infrequent farmer-to-animal contact. Accelerometers allow the measurements of movements of a body in space and are currently very popular sensors in the zootechnical field for monitoring livestock as they can be worn without being invasive for animals. Therefore, the aim of this research activity was to prove the feasibility of using acceleration thresholds for the automatic detection of grazing cow behavioural activities. In this study, a customized electronic device equipped with a triaxial accelerometer was built and placed in a collar of a grazing cow. The accelerometer data acquired at 4 Hz from the device were sent to a cloud server one time an hour. Then they were subsequently analysed to be able to establish thresholds for the discrimination of cow behaviours. As stated in previous studies, algorithms based on statistically defined acceleration thresholds could be easily implemented in a firmware for real-time detection of cow behaviour, therefore, they could be a valuable low-cost tool for monitoring livestock in extensive farms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Facing worldwide environmental changes and a trend towards more conscious and healthy eating behaviors, the development of a stable animal breeding industry is a significant challenge for the near future. In the present review, factors influencing semen handling in camelids, goats and sheep are described and relevant methods as well as current trends to improve liquid-storage of cooled semen are discussed, including extenders, additives, cooling rates, and storage temperatures. The species-specific physiology and resulting challenges are taken into consideration. While the main problem for camelid semen processing is the relatively greater viscosity as compared with that of some other animals, the deciding factor for successful artificial insemination (AI) in goats and sheep is the site (i.e., cervical or vaginal) of semen placement in the reproductive tract. Due to the type of cervical anatomy, the penetration of the cervix when using AI instruments is rather difficult. Furthermore, the seminal plasma of small ruminants affects the interaction with milk-based extenders and egg yolk which results in species-specific regimens for cooled liquid-preservation. Comparing all three species, the greatest pregnancy rates were obtained by AI with goat semen after cooled liquid-storage for several days. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With the ever-increasing importance of dairy and meat production, precision livestock farming (PLF) using advanced information technologies is emerging to improve farming production systems. The latest automation, connectivity, and artificial intelligence developments open new horizons to monitor livestock in the pasture, controlled environments, and open environments. Due to the significance of livestock detection and tracking, this systematic review extracts and summarizes the existing deep learning (DL) techniques in PLF using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). In the context of livestock recognition studies, UAVs are receiving growing attention due to their flexible data acquisition and operation in different conditions. This review examines the implemented DL architectures and scrutinizes the broadly exploited evaluation metrics, attributes, and databases. The classification of most UAV livestock monitoring systems using DL techniques is in three categories: detection, classification, and localization. Correspondingly, this paper discusses the future benefits and drawbacks of these DL-based PLF approaches using UAV imagery. Additionally, this paper describes alternative methods used to mitigate issues in PLF. The aim of this work is to provide insights into the most relevant studies on the development of UAV-based PLF systems focused on deep neural network-based techniques.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background and Aim: Trimmed asparagus by-products (TABP) is the resultant waste from asparagus possessing. TABP has fructans, such as inulins and fructooligosaccharide, which can be utilized as an alternative prebiotic. This study was conducted to examine the effect of TABP dietary supplementation on the productive performance, nutrient digestibility, gut microbiota, volatile fatty acid (VFA) content, small-intestine histology, and meat quality of broilers. Materials and Methods: A total of 320 1-day-old broiler chicks (Ross 308®) were raised under ambient temperature and assigned through a completely randomized design to one of four dietary treatments, with four replicates per treatment. The dietary treatments comprised corn-soybean basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 10, 30, or 50 g/kg TABP. All birds were provided drinking water and feed ad libitum to meet the standard nutritional requirements of National Research Council for broiler chickens. Results: TABP supplementation to the broilers significantly increased the apparent ether extract, crude fiber, and gross energy digestibility (p<0.05). TABP supplementation significantly increased lactic bacteria and Enterococcus spp. numbers as well as acetic, propionic, butyric, and total VFA levels (p<0.01); on the other hand, it also significantly decreased Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli contents in the cecum compared with the control group (p<0.01). Moreover, TABP supplementation increased villus height in the duodenum and jejunum (p<0.01), cryptal depth in the jejunum and ileum (p<0.01), and villus surface areas in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (p<0.01). Overall, 0-35 day TABP supplementation significantly increased the feed intake (p<0.01) and average daily gain of broilers (p<0.05), but not significantly affected the viability, productive index, and economic benefit return (p>0.05). The carcass characteristics, pH, color, and water holding capacity of the chicken meat between groups were not significantly different (p>0.05). All levels of TABP supplementation appeared to be a feasible means of producing broilers with the lower serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as atherogenic indices of serum compared with the control (p<0.05). Cholesterol contents and palmitic acid, oleic acid, saturated fatty acids, and Monounsaturated fatty acids levels decreased with an increase of TABP supplementation (p<0.05). Furthermore, TABP supplementation decreased atherogenic index (AI) and thrombogenicity index (TI) of meat (p<0.05). Conclusion: Supplementation of 30 g/kg TABP in broiler diet could enhance broiler performance and provide chicken meat with beneficial properties, with decreased AI and TI resulted from altered cholesterol and fatty acid profiles.

	abstract = {Background and Aim: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have previously been isolated from animals’ testes, cultured in vitro, and successfully transplanted into compatible recipients. The SSC unique characteristic has potential for exploitation as a reproductive tool and this can be achieved through SSC intratesticular transplantation to surrogate sires. Here, we aimed at comprehensively analyzing published data on in vitro maintenance of SSC isolated from the testes of livestock animals and their applications. Materials and Methods: The literature search was performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar electronic databases. Data screening was conducted using Rayyan Intelligent Systematic Review software (https://www.rayyan.ai/). Duplicate papers were excluded from the study. Abstracts were read and relevant full papers were reviewed for data extraction. Results: From a total of 4786 full papers screened, data were extracted from 93 relevant papers. Of these, eight papers reported on long-term culture conditions (>1 month) for SSC in different livestock species, 22 papers on short-term cultures (5-15 days), 10 papers on transfection protocols, 18 papers on transplantation using different methods of preparation of livestock recipients, and five papers on donor-derived spermatogenesis. Conclusion: Optimization of SSC long-term culture systems has renewed the possibilities of utilization of these cells in gene-editing technologies to develop transgenic animals. Further, the development of genetically deficient recipients in the endogenous germline layer lends to a future possibility for the utilization of germ cell transplantation in livestock systems.

	abstract = {Low fertilization rate is the main reason to limit the development of artificial insemination (AI) technology in ducks. However, the libido of male livestock has been confirmed to be related to semen quality and fertilization rate, and we found that the libido of drakes was different. Thus, the research on the libido of drakes may be the key to further develop and apply AI technology. In this research, we established the first scoring standard for libido evaluation in drakes based on the performance of drakes during training period. Phenotypically, the body weight of high libido group was lighter than that of the other groups, while the weight of testis and epididymis in the high libido group was higher than that in the low libido group. Furthermore, we constructed the first expression profile of hypothalamus, pituitary, testis, and epididymis of drakes with high or low libido. There were 2, 1822, 214, and 892 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in hypothalamus, pituitary, testis, and epididymis. The expression and sequence of Translocation Associated Membrane Protein 2 (TRAM2) were different in high and low libido drakes, indicating that it may be a candidate gene related to drake's libido. The estrogen, prolactin, and oxytocin signaling pathways were all activated in the pituitary of the low libido group. Meanwhile, the metabolic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were enriched by DEGs in pituitary, testis and epididymis. Our research reveals that the difference in metabolic may cause changes in body weight of drakes, resulting in altered hormone levels and oxidative phosphorylation of gonad, which negatively affects libido and spermatogenesis in drakes. These results provide novel insights into the avian libido and will help better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Nowadays one can observe the penetration of digitalization into almost all spheres of life: political, social, economic, educational. Agriculture is not an exception. Russian government considers digital transformation in general and agriculture in particular to be one of the indispensable national goals. The ultimate goal of introducing digital changes is guaranteeing the RF entry into the top five largest economies in the world. Agriculture in RF has various branches where animal husbandry plays and important role in ensuring food security. Consequently, the issue of introducing digitalization into livestock farming as a less advanced industry is rather relevant. Digital data is becoming a key factor in the livestock industry. This data can be obtained from various devices, in particular from biometric sensors, big data and blockchain technology. Precision Livestock farming (PLF) technologies enable non-invasive sampling, helping farmers and researchers to obtain realistic indicators to solve welfare problems. The received and processed data allow obtaining information having new quality characteristics, searching for and finding patterns and models for agricultural successful modernization, minimizing risks of losses, forecasting using modern methods of big data processing, optimizing production costs. PLF technologies can also contribute to a reduction in resource use. They will definitely facilitate individualistic approach and a more proactive to animal health. Such an approach will ultimately reduce the need for medicines, especially the use of antibiotics. The use of innovative solutions was noted, in particular, the use of automated technologies, robotic systems, computerized programs, applications that contribute to the growth of productivity and the production of livestock products. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Smart technologies and its application have shown great promise for the modernization of extension services in both developed and developing countries. Improving rural livelihoods through smart technologies is one of the key areas, which has potential to change the livestock economy. Enormous increase in the mobile and internet users has ushered in a revolution in ICT research and development. We wouldn’t be wrong if we dubbed this period the “ICT Era”. The government of India’s Digital India Mission, as well as telecom providers’ provision of affordable pricing to subscribers, have cleared the road for internet technology to reach everyone’s doorstep. Many public and private organizations involved in research related to the livestock sector have developed many such ICTs for the use of livestock farmers. Improved package of practices are being provided to the farmers by the use of mobile apps, expert systems, and web portals whereas the regular advisories are provided to them through tele-services, SMS and Remote Sensing based tools. The animals are being identified by the use of RFID tags which are helping livestock farmers as well as the resource-based companies for resource disposal. Furthermore, the farmers are connected to peers through social media and mobile telephony like Kisan Call Centre. The new buzzword, i.e. Artificial intelligence (AI) through its diverse applications has the potential to revolutionize the livestock industry, like; artificial neural networks, deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, cloud computing, block chain technology, internet of things, precision farming, sensor based systems, robotics, and so forth. It is also predicted that AI will lead in the world’s “fourth industrial revolution”. Which will be a digital revolution. All of these technologies work together to create an “Information Web” for farmers, which is in charge of disseminating timely livestock development information. This chapter details the ICTs which are in use by the livestock farmers and the ones which are yet to come. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

	abstract = {The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a public health emergency that turns the year 2020–2021 into annus horribilis for millions of people across international boundaries. The interspecies transmission of this zoonotic virus and mutated variants are aided by exposure dynamics of infected aerosols, fomites and intermediate reservoirs. The spike in the first, second and third waves of coronavirus confirms that herd immunity is not yet reached and everyone including livestock is still vulnerable to the infection. Of serious concern are the communitarian nature of agrarians in the livestock sector, aerogenous spread of the virus and attendant cytocidal effect in permissive cells following activation of pathogen recognition receptors, replication cycles, virulent mutations, seasonal spike in infection rates, flurry of reinfections and excess mortalities that can affect animal welfare and food security. As the capacity to either resist or be susceptible to infection is influenced by numerous factors, identifying coronavirus-associated variants and correlating exposure dynamics with viral aerosols, spirometry indices, comorbidities, susceptible blood types, cellular miRNA binding sites and multisystem inflammatory syndrome remains a challenge where the lethal zoonotic infections are prevalent in the livestock industry, being the hub of dairy, fur, meat and egg production. This review provides insights into the complexity of the disease burden and recommends precision smart-farming models for upscaling biosecurity measures and adoption of digitalised technologies (robotic drones) powered by multiparametric sensors and radio modem systems for real-time tracking of infectious strains in the agro-environment and managing the transition into the new-normal realities in the livestock industry. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in animal health (AH) makes it possible to address highly complex issues such as those encountered in quantitative and predictive epidemiology, animal/human precision-based medicine, or to study host × pathogen interactions. AI may contribute (i) to diagnosis and disease case detection, (ii) to more reliable predictions and reduced errors, (iii) to representing more realistically complex biological systems and rendering computing codes more readable to non-computer scientists, (iv) to speeding-up decisions and improving accuracy in risk analyses, and (v) to better targeted interventions and anticipated negative effects. In turn, challenges in AH may stimulate AI research due to specificity of AH systems, data, constraints, and analytical objectives. Based on a literature review of scientific papers at the interface between AI and AH covering the period 2009–2019, and interviews with French researchers positioned at this interface, the present study explains the main AH areas where various AI approaches are currently mobilised, how it may contribute to renew AH research issues and remove methodological or conceptual barriers. After presenting the possible obstacles and levers, we propose several recommendations to better grasp the challenge represented by the AH/AI interface. With the development of several recent concepts promoting a global and multisectoral perspective in the field of health, AI should contribute to defract the different disciplines in AH towards more transversal and integrative research. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Multiple Ovulation and Embryo Transfer (MOET) technology is a potential technique to upgrade livestock species' genetics. The varied response to super-stimulatory treatments remains one of the limiting factors to this technology's widespread use. The present study was aimed to improve the superovulation response and in-vivo embryo production by using controlled internal drug release (CIDR)-GnRH or CIDREB (Estradiol Benzoate) along with conventional superovulation protocol in Holstein Frisian (HF): Bos taurus; n = 42) and Crossbred (XB: Cholistani (Bos indicus) × HF; n D 28) cows. In the CIDR-GnRH/CIDR-EB treatment, CIDR was implanted in the cows after confirming the presence of a corpus luteum (CL) on the 8th day after estrus. 2 ml GnRH (Lecirelin acetate 0.0262 mg/ml) or 2 mg EB was also administered in CIDR-GnRH/CIDR-EB groups, respectively. Both groups were given super-stimulatory treatment from the 11th day after estrus (FSH in tapering doses twice a day for four consecutive days). On day 13, two doses of 2 ml prostaglandin (75 μg/ml of dextrorotatory cloprostenol) were administered (am: pm), and CIDR was removed the following day. Two artificial inseminations (AI) of the cows were performed (12 h apart) on the 15th day. No CIDR and GnRH/E.B were given in the control group, but the remaining superovulation protocol was the same. Later on, seven days after the first AI, non-surgical embryo flushing was done. The transferable embryos produced from three different superovulation protocols were then transferred into the recipient cows (n D 90) for determining their fertility. Statistical analysis revealed that the number of super-estrus follicles (SEF), multiple corpora lutea (MCL), ovulation/fertilization percentage, fertilized structures recovered (FSR), and transferable embryos (TEs) remained significantly higher (p < 0.05), and days taken for return to estrus (RTE) after embryo collection remained significantly lower (p < 0.05) in CIDR-GnRH (nD18) and CIDR-EB (nD15) groups as compared to the control (nD37). The comparison between XB and HF cows revealed that the TEs production in CIDR-GnRH (XB D 5 vs HF = 13) and CIDR-EB (XB = 6 vs HF = 9) based superovulation protocols were 11:60 ± 4:08 vs 04:31 ± 0:98 and 09:33 ± 1:78 vs 05:22 ± 1:36, respectively. TEs production in XB cows (nD5) of the CIDR-GnRH group was significantly higher (11:60 ± 4:08) than other groups. On the other hand, the days taken for RTE after embryo collection remained significantly lower (p < 0.05) in HF cows of treatment groups. However, the fertility of TEs was neither affected significantly (p > 0.05) by the superovulation protocol used nor by breed differences among donor cows. In conclusion, using CIDR-GnRH or CIDR-EB along with conventional superovulation protocol may enhance the efficiency of MOET programs in cattle. Furthermore, XB donor cows demonstrated a better performance than HF donor cows under subtropical conditions. © 2021 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies correspond to the deployment of electronic devices and digital tools to manage livestock production efficiently. This systematic review compiles the results of review studies on the use of PLF technologies in poultry farming, synthesizing the report of factors such as the technologies used, their application context, study subjects, production stages evaluated, challenges encountered and future opportunities. For this, a study search strategy applied in 8 academic databases was designed within the framework established by the definition of eligibility criteria and the application of quality assessment tools of the studies found. As a result, 13 studies were included: 2 systematic reviews and 11 narratives reviews. The application of optical technologies was reported in all 13 studies, followed the use of sensors in 7 studies (biosensors, wearable and/or environmental sensors), the analysis of sounds captured by microphones in 4 studies, and the use of autonomous agricultural robots in 2 of them. In addition, 4 studies considered the application of PLF technologies in the egg handling stage, 9 in the poultry rearing stage and 4 in the meat processing stage. It is concluded that there is a need to deepen the research on the application of PLF technologies of a commercial nature in real poultry production contexts, involving producers to determine those implementations that add greater value to their business.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Low fertility is the single most important factor limiting livestock reproductive performance, adversely affecting the cattle industry and causing millions of dollars of economic loss. In the livestock industry, male fertility is of crucial importance for the reproductive performance of livestock. However, there is a lack of reliable biomarkers to predict bull fertility in artificial insemination service. The objective of this study was to identify sperm proteins as biomarkers for bull fertility. To discover candidate sperm quality biomarkers, sperm proteome profiling was conducted in extreme high- and extreme low-fertile bulls selected from a pool of 1000 AI sires with varied fertility. Thirty-two differentially expressed proteins were identified. Among them, high levels of sperm outer dense fiber of sperm tails 2 (ODF2) and post-acrosomal assembly of sperm head protein (PAWP/WBP2NL) represented the most extreme differences in quantity between high- and low-fertility bulls. Protein immunodetection and flow cytometry used to validate these putative fertility markers in a combined cohort of 154 AI sires. Both ODF2 and PAWP correlated significantly with fertility. In conclusion, ODF2 and PAWP can be used to assess semen quality and predict sire fertility. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Currently, rabbit animal feed is still done manually so its consistency is less guaranteed. Therefore, a tool is designed to feed livestock automatically by using Real-Time Clock as a comparison of time to set the feeding schedule. At each hour of feeding, the servo motor will open the feed container valve. Next, the feed will come down from the shelter and fill the container below it which is equipped with a load cell. When the feed weight has been measured at 100 grams, the servo motor will close the valve again. The system uses solar panels as a power plant equipped with a charge controller and a 6V/12Ah battery which then the battery is used as a supply for a load of a 15W/6V servo motor and a 5W/6V LED lamp as lighting at night to reduce interference from night animals that usually eat rabbit chicks or even eat rabbit pellets as well. However, because the output of solar panels is unstable, buck-boost converters are sought to help the stability of charging the battery at a voltage of 7.2V by using fuzzy controls. From the results of simulation tests using Matlab for charging control with fuzzy methods obtained the result that the output voltage of the converter has reached the setpoint and after being given some interference, the system can maintain the voltage of the output at a value of 7.2V.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: As a neglected cross-species parasitic disease transmitted between canines and livestock, echinococcosis remains a global public health concern with a heavy disease burden. In China, especially in the epidemic pastoral communities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the harsh climate, low socio-economic status, poor overall hygiene, and remote and insufficient access to all owned dogs exacerbate the difficulty in implementing the ambitious control programme for echinococcosis. We aimed to design and implement a remote management system (RMS) based on internet of things (IoT) for control and surveillance of echinococcosis by combining deworming devices to realise long-distance smart deworming control, smooth statistical analysis and result display. New methods and tools are urgently needed to increase the deworming coverage and frequency, promote real-time scientific surveillance, and prevent transmission of echinococcosis in remoted transmission areas. Methods: From 2016 to 2019, we had cooperated and developed the smart collar and smart feeder with the Central Research Institute of Shanghai Electric Group Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and Shenzhen Jizhi Future Technology Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). From September 2019 to March 2020, We had proposed the RMS based on IoT as a novel tool to control smart deworming devices to deliver efficient praziquantel (PZQ) baits to dogs regularly and automatically and also as a smart digital management platform to monitor, analyse, and display the epidemic trends of echinococcosis dynamically, in real time in Hezuo City, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, China. Starting from January 2018, The RMS has been maintained and upgraded by Shanghai Yier Information Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The database was based on MySQL tools and the Chi-square test was used to probe the difference and changes of variables in different groups. Results: The smart collars are fully capable of anti-collision, waterproof, and cold-proof performance, and the battery’s energy is sufficient, the anti-collision rate, water-proof rate, cold-proof rate and voltage normal rate is 99.6% (521/523), 100.0% (523/523), 100.0% (523/523) and 100.0% (523/523), respectively. The RMS can accurately analyse the monitoring data and parameters including positive rates of canine faeces, and the prevalence of echinococcosis in the general population livestock, and children. The data of dogs deworming and surveillance for echinococcosis is able to be controlled using RMS and has expanded gradually in townships to the whole Hezuo region. The automatic delivering PZQ rate, collar positioning rate, deliver PZQ reminding rate, and fault report rate is 91.1% (1914/2102), 92.1% (13 580/14 745), 92.1% (1936/2102) and 84.7% (1287/1519), respectively. After using the RMS from 2019, the missing rate of monitoring data decreased from 32.1% (9/28) to 0 (0/16). A total of 48 administrators (3, 3, 8, 11, 23 at the provincial, municipal, county, township, village levels, respectively) participated in the questionnaire survey, with 93.8% of its overall satisfaction rate. Conclusions: The existing difficulties and challenges in the way of prevention and control for echinococcosis can partially be resolved using the innovative, IoT-based technologies and tools. The proposed RMS advance the upgrade of existing manual prevention and control models for echinococcosis, especially in the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as social distance and community blockade continue.

Automated handling of carcasses require high level of intelligence, autonomy and adaptability, thus AI-driven systems, various sensors and intelligent tools are necessary parts of such systems. This paper presents novel force control methods implemented in a smart gripper intended for automated pig cutting. While the gripper is capable of handling high payloads (whole legs and 15-20 kg of intestines), the force control algorithm also allows delicate grasping on soft tissues. The gripping force is estimated separately for the two fingers of the gripper based on novel timing belt strain measurement methods. The elongation of the belts are measured by strain-gauges, and by magnetic encoders measuring the rotations of axes. The force sensors were tested with a tensile testing machine, and the functioning force-controlled gripper was tested with real pig carcasses too. The sensors have also proved useful for giving other feedback during automated pig cutting too, such as warning about inadequate gripper positioning relative to the target, and error signal generation when the target object slipped out of the gripper.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The key of the proposed system includes two designs: Deep-net assembling as a semantic surveillance service and the expandable-convolutional-block neural network (ECB-Net). The first is a development architecture of the divide-and-conquer philosophy for establishing semantic surveillance systems, and this work provides a concrete instance for promoting deep-net assembling to livestock industries. The second is an AIoT device-friendly neural network for filtering insignificant camera images to achieve high robustness of smart surveillance systems. The technical details from the architecture design to optimal ECB-Net model creation are presented in related sections. Finally, we develop the prototype of the smart livestock surveillance system and deploy it by swine rooms for conducting real-world integrated tests.

	abstract = {Synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilization has helped boost agricultural yields, but it is also responsible for direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Fertilizer-related emissions are also promoted by irrigation and manure application, which has increased with livestock industrialization. Spanish agriculture provides a paradigmatic example of high industrialization under two different climates (temperate and Mediterranean) and two contrasting water management regimes (rainfed and irrigated). In this study, we estimated the historical evolution of the C footprint of N fertilization (including all the life cycle GHG emissions related to N fertilization) in Spanish agriculture from 1860 to 2018 at the province level (50 provinces) for 122 crops, using climate-specific N2O emission factors (EFs) adjusted to the type of water management and the N source (synthetic fertilizer, animal manure, crop residues and soil N mineralization) and considering changes in the industrial efficiency of N fertilizer production. Overall, N-related GHG emissions increased ∼12-fold, up to 10-14 Tg CO2e yr-1 in the 2010s, with much higher growth in Mediterranean than in temperate areas. Direct N2O EFs of N fertilizers doubled due to the expansion of irrigation, synthetic fertilizers and liquid manure, associated with livestock industrialization. Synthetic N production dominated the emissions balance (55%-60% of GHGe in the 21st century). Large energy efficiency gains of industrial fertilizer production were largely offset by the changes in the fertilizer mix. Downstream N2O emissions associated with NH3 volatilization and NO3- leaching increased tenfold. The yield-scaled carbon footprint of N use in Spanish agriculture increased fourfold, from 4 and 5 Mg CO2e Mg N-1 to 16-18 Mg CO2e Mg N-1. Therefore, the results reported herein indicate that increased productivity could not offset the growth in manufacture and soil emissions related to N use, suggesting that mitigation efforts should not only aim to increase N use efficiency but also consider water management, fertilizer type and fertilizer manufacture as key drivers of emissions. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The agriculture industry is undergoing a rapid digital transformation and is growing powerful by the pillars of cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and allied technologies. At the core of artificial intelligence, deep learning-based computer vision enables various agriculture activities to be performed automatically with utmost precision enabling smart agriculture into reality. Computer vision techniques, in conjunction with high-quality image acquisition using remote cameras, enable non-contact and efficient technology-driven solutions in agriculture. This review contributes to providing state-of-the-art computer vision technologies based on deep learning that can assist farmers in operations starting from land preparation to harvesting. Recent works in the area of computer vision were analyzed in this paper and categorized into (a) seed quality analysis, (b) soil analysis, (c) irrigation water management, (d) plant health analysis, (e) weed management (f) livestock management and (g) yield estimation. The paper also discusses recent trends in computer vision such as generative adversarial networks (GAN), vision transformers (ViT) and other popular deep learning architectures. Additionally, this study pinpoints the challenges in implementing the solutions in the farmer's field in real-time. The overall finding indicates that convolutional neural networks are the corner stone of modern computer vision approaches and their various architectures provide high-quality solutions across various agriculture activities in terms of precision and accuracy. However, the success of the computer vision approach lies in building the model on a quality dataset and providing real-time solutions. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Bovine trypanosomiasis is a key constraint to increased livestock production across all production systems of Kwale County in coastal Kenya. Genetically controlled trypanotolerance of cattle is regarded as one of the promising methods available to mitigate the impact of this disease, and the improved trypanonotolerant Orma Boran is one of the breeds available in Kenya for this purpose. Conjoint analysis was thus used to match farmer’s preference for cattle traits against those conferred by this breed in three production systems of Kwale County. The study also estimated the transaction costs (TC) that would influence access to breeding services while availing the breed. The aim was to identify production systems where the breed matches well with farmer preferences, as an initial step towards its dissemination. In order of importance, farmers preferred cattle that were resistant to trypanosomiasis, had large body size, exhibited resistance to tick-borne-diseases (TBD), and had high milk output. However, there were inter-production system differences in trait preferences, where resistance to TBD was least valued in agro-pastoral system, with more emphasis put on size of animal and trypanotolerance respectively. On the other hand, in medium potential and marginal pastoral systems, more emphasis was placed on TBD resistance, followed by trypanosomiasis resistance. The agro-pastoral production system was therefore delineated as a potential area for disseminating the breed. Regarding transaction costs, price of service was the most important transaction costs element. Furthermore, whereas bull service was preferred over artificial insemination (AI) services in marginal pastoral and medium potential systems, AI was given preference in agro-pastoral system. It was thus concluded that the Orma Boran dissemination would be successful among agro-pastoral households system, and should be delivered using subsidised AI services. © 2021, East African Science and Technology Commission - EASTECO KG.

	abstract = {Insects are part of the diet of over 2 billion people worldwide; however, insects have not been popular in Europe, neither as food nor as a feed ingredient. This has been changing in recent years, due to increased knowledge regarding the nutritional benefits, the need for novel protein production and the low environmental impact of insects compared to conventional protein production. The purpose of this study is to give an overview of the most popular insects farmed in Europe, yellow mealworm, Tenebrio molitor, and black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens, together with the main obstacles and risks. A comprehensive literature study was carried out and 27 insect farming companies found listed in Europe were contacted directly. The results show that the insect farming industry is increasing in Europe, and the success of the frontrunners is based on large investments in technology, automation and economy of scale. The interest of venture capital firms is noticeable, covering 90% of the investment costs in some cases. It is concluded that insect farming in Europe is likely to expand rapidly in the coming years, offering new proteins and other valuable products, not only as a feed ingredient, but also for human consumption. European regulations have additionally been rapidly changing, with more freedom towards insects as food and feed. There is an increased knowledge regarding safety concerns of edible insects, and the results indicate that edible insects pose a smaller risk for zoonotic diseases than livestock. However, knowledge regarding risk posed by edible insects is still lacking, but food and feed safety is essential to put products on the European market. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Volcanic activity in the equator is concentrated in the continental volcanic arc of the central-north portion of the Andes resulting from the subduction of the Nazca plate underneath the South American plate. This produces a high risk, evidenced in recent decades as an increased volcanic activity and a high impact on the population - especially those in poverty and extreme poverty - and on the country's economy. The Guagua Pichincha volcano developed in three periods during the late Pleistocene and Holocene; together with the Rucu Pichincha, it forms the Pichincha volcanic complex. This complex recorded its latest eruption between 1999 and 2001 through the Crystal Dome with vulcanian-subplinian explosions. Guagua Pichincha is considered the third most dangerous volcano in continental Ecuador, posing a threat mainly to vulnerable rural population settled in areas close to the volcano and dedicated to agriculture and livestock raising. This research has used general parameters such as height of the eruptive column, duration of the eruption, volume of magma, and a statistical distribution of wind profiles. We obtained four eruption events that are consistent with events that occurred in the past recorded by several authors. Using a statistical analysis, we modeled 120 numerical simulations per event with the Ash 3D code. Using algorithms produced with digital tools, the dispersal and fall of ash was defined under a 75% probability of occurrence for the period 2008 - 2017, for zoning volcanic threat through the eruptive scenarios suggested. Census data of the 15 indicators (eight for vulnerability and seven for resilience) for the year 2010 were processed separately. As a result, we obtained a cover with parochial disaggregation at country level using the weights assigned in the Index for Risk Management (INFORM) methodology. Following this procedure, we estimated the magnitudes of rural-urban population and land-use categories that would be affected by using spatial analysis and automation processes through Phyton programming. Impact scenarios would have different effects according to the maximum expected thickness values estimated. The lower limit of the range is 5 mm assuming the most frequent scenario within the yearly eruptive cycle, with a volcanic explosiveness index (VEI) of 2; the upper limit is 150 mm of ash accumulation in a scenario with a VEI5, which occurs every 25 eruptive cycles and has been recorded every 2,500-21,250 years; the latter involves a significant increase in the number of villages, urban areas and, land-use categories affected. The maps obtained show the following. 1) For the VEI2 (minor) event, some 23,435 hectares dedicated to agriculture would be directly affected by the different ash thicknesses, representing one parish with moderate impact and seven parishes with low impact; for this scenario, the experience derived from the latest activity event recorded may be used to quantify the potential impact of the Guagua Pichincha volcano in the country. 2) A VEI3 (moderate) event, which occurs with a frequency between one and two events within an eruptive cycle, would result in 1,101,847 ha of farming land directly affected by ash fall, with thicknesses reaching 45 mm; 20 parishes would have a high impact, 119 parishes a moderate impact, and 78 parishes a low impact. 3) For a major event (VEI4) of the Guagua Pichincha volcano, which occurs every three to five eruptive cycles, recorded every 300-4,250 years, the expected ash thicknesses would range between 0.01 mm and 90 mm, affecting 1,130,405 ha of farmland; 98 parishes would suffer moderate impact and 66 low impact; a total of 4,240,559 inhabitants would be directly affected. 4) For scenario VEI5, 1,899,861 ha of farming land would be directly affected, including 33 parishes with a high impact, 235 parishes with moderate impact and 139 with a low impact. A VEI5 event would affect 30% of the population of Ecuador. © 2021 Instituto de Geografia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Crop diseases caused by Fusarium pathogens, among other microorganisms, threaten crop production in both commercial and smallholder farming. There are increasing concerns about the use of conventional synthetic fungicides due to fungal resistance and the associated negative effects of these chemicals on human health, livestock and the environment. This leads to the search for alternative fungicides from nature, especially from plants. The objectives of this study were to characterize isolated compounds from Combretum erythrophyllum (Burch.) Sond. and Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal leaf extracts, evaluate their antifungal activity against Fusarium pathogens, their phytotoxicity on maize seed germination and their cytotoxicity effect on Raw 264.7 macrophage cells. The investigation led to the isolation of antifungal compounds characterized as 5-hydroxy-7,4’-dimethoxyflavone, maslinic acid (21-hydroxy-3-oxo-olean-12-en-28-oic acid) and withaferin A (4β,27-dihydroxy-1-oxo-5β,6β-epoxywitha-2-24-dienolide). The structural elucidation of the isolated compounds was established using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy (MS) and, in comparison, with the available published data. These compounds showed good antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) less than 1.0 mg/mL against one or more of the tested Fusarium pathogens (F. oxys-porum, F. verticilloides, F. subglutinans, F. proliferatum, F. solani, F. graminearum, F. chlamydosporum and F. semitectum). The findings from this study indicate that medicinal plants are a good source of natural antifungals. Furthermore, the isolated antifungal compounds did not show any phytotoxic effects on maize seed germination. The toxicity of the compounds A (5-hydroxy-7,4’-dimethoxyflavone) and AI (4β,27-dihydroxy-1-oxo-5β,6β-epoxywitha-2-24-dienolide) was dose-dependent, while compound B (21-hydroxy-3-oxo-olean-12-en-28-oic acid) showed no toxicity effect against Raw 264.7 macrophage cells. © 2021 by the authors.

Precision agriculture (PA) and precision livestock farming (PLF) are introduced to assist in optimizing agricultural and livestock production while minimizing the wastes and costs. In this chapter, CYBELE is introduced, a platform aspiring to ensure that the stakeholders involved in the PA and PLF value chain (research and academia, SMEs, entrepreneurs, etc.) are granted unmediated access to a vast amount of very large-scale and distributed datasets. Additionally, by leveraging the convergence of big data, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing infrastructures, CYBELE facilitates these stakeholders to generate value and extract insights out of the data through advanced data exploration, aggregation, processing, training, analysis, and visualization services. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Olivier Terzo and Jan Martinovic; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {A growing world population requires sufficient food to sustain itself. Therefore, increasingly more resources are required to produce the food. Insects are a viable food and feed alternative since their production requires only a fraction of the resources that conventional livestock needs. For the efficient production of insects, automation technology is needed. An automatic monitoring of the insects’ growth ensures stable production processes and a high product quality. The use of a camera with image processing using neural networks makes it possible to detect insects, measure their features such as shape and colour and enables to derive their age, size, and health. In this paper, instance segmentation using mask scoring regional convolutional neural network (Mask Scoring R-CNN) shows good results in detecting house crickets (Acheta domesticus). A dataset is created consisting of six images, showing 1,022 insect instances, of a real-world cricket production facility to train and test the algorithm. Furthermore, image augmentation by cropping, flipping and rotating is applied to the set to solve the problem of limited data. By combining the augmentations, 288 different trainings are compared to find the best augmentation strategy. The evaluation of the algorithm uses two variations of the F1-score: one variation to estimate the capabilities of producing qualitative segmentation masks and another to estimate the detection capabilities. For the estimation of the detection capabilities, a rule termed ‘centre over ground truth’ is developed. The results show that the presented method is suitable for monitoring a cricket production facility with a recall of 76.6% and a precision of 96.2%. © 2022. Wageningen Academic Publishers},

	abstract = {The livestock industry in Indonesia is dominated by smallholder farmers. Crossbreeding between local and exotic breeds is a common practice by these farmers in order to improve productivity. This study is evaluated the crossbreeding strategy between Boer goat and Jawarandu goats by observing the pre-weaning traits. In total of 3,815 records were obtained from the kids born between 2012–2015. The recorded data of offspring from three mating scenarios: B×B (Boer and Boer), B×J (Boer and Jawarandu), and B×(B×J) (Boer bucks and B×J does) were investigated. The birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), and average daily gain (ADG) were analysed. For all traits, B×B kids were compared to the other sub-populations. Genetic parameters for each trait were estimated using univariate animal models and solved via average information restricted maximum likelihood (AI-REML) procedures. The heritability of BW were 0.38±0.12, 0.41±0.0 and 0.12±0.07, respectively, and weaning weights were 0.12±0.07, 0.24±0.07 and 0.08±0.06, respectively. The heritability for ADG were 0.13±0.07, 0.14±0.05, and 0.06±0.05 for B×B, B×J, and B×(B×J) sub-populations, respectively. Genetic correlations among pre-weaning traits were generally high (>70%), while the phenotypic correlations were low to moderate. A crossbreeding system in which the two parental breeds were maximally differed as the best scenario. It produced higher additive genetic variability, corresponding to the higher chance of improvement through between-breed selection on pre-weaning traits. © 2021 Association of Agricultural Technology in Southeast Asia.

Automation is known as the revolution in technology and has an enormous positive impact across domains regions. Automation's foremost objective is to increase production. Exponential growth in the population of the country demands the need to have exponential growth in the food production. Question arises what governs the increased food productionƒ One of the answers is adequate availability of nutrient contents in the soil is the governing factor that affects the food production which needs to be monitored regularly. The Exponential growth in the food production can only be achieved through Agriculture Automation. Agriculture automation can be achieved by adopting multiple technologies that are available like wireless communication, AI and ML, deep learning, big data analytics, and IoT. etc. Maintaining adequate availability of nutrient contents, that are site crop specific in the soil, using Soil Health Monitoring [SHM] system becomes the major challenge that needs to be addressed using the Automation technologies. This article discusses various SSNM [Site Specific Nutrient Management] systems available, possibility of integration with Automation technologies that in turn will aid in SHM by proposing sitecrop specific fertilizer timely.  © 2022 IEEE.},

At present, scoring lesions is a challenging and time‐consuming activity, which is carried out by veterinarians serving the slaughter chain. Over recent years, artificial intelligence(AI) has gained traction in many fields of research, including livestock production. In particular, AI‐based methods appear able to solve highly repetitive tasks and to consistently analyze large amounts of data, such as those collected by veterinarians during postmortem inspection in high‐throughput slaughterhouses. The present study aims to develop an AI‐based method capable of recognizing and quantifying enzootic pneumonia‐like lesions on digital images captured from slaughtered pigs under routine abattoir conditions. Overall, the data indicate that the AI‐based method proposed herein could properly identify and score enzootic pneumonia‐like lesions without interfering with the slaughter chain routine. According to European legislation, the application of such a method avoids the handling of carcasses and organs, decreasing the risk of microbial contamination, and could provide further alternatives in the field of food hygiene. © 2021 by the authors.

Computer Vision (CV) enables remote, real-time, and noninvasive observation and monitoring of animals by employing detection and tracking algorithms. The integration of Deep Learning (DL) enhances the ability of computers to analyze, interpret and infer the information received. In this study, an Intelligent quail activity monitoring system (I-QAMS) is introduced. It provides detection and monitoring of quail feeding pattern and locomotion activities reared in a cage. In addition, it estimates the activeness based on the level of agility of the poultry animal. These parameters can be used as indicators to assess animal health. YOLOv7, a DL-based single stage detector, is employed for detection and classification of behavioral activities. The DeepSORT algorithm, an algorithm utilizing Kalman filter, Hungarian Algorithm, and Convolutional Neural Network (CCN), is employed for tracking. To evaluate the bird's movement, the displacement of the centroid is determined using Euclidean distance. A 500-frame video sequence, approximately 20 seconds in length, is utilized for the agility assessment. The YOLOv7 achieved a mAP of 85.28 in training, and an accuracy of 90.49 on test scenes. The results show the potential of CV- and DL-based detectors and trackers such as YOLO and DeepSORT for poultry behavior monitoring and estimation of the animal's welfare. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Inspection of livestock farms using surveillance cameras is emerging as a means of early detection of transboundary animal disease such as African swine fever (ASF). Object tracking, a developing technology derived from object detection aims to the consistent identification of individual objects in farms. Objectives: This study was conducted as a preliminary investigation for practical application to livestock farms. With the use of a high-performance artificial intelligence (AI)-based 3D depth camera, the aim is to establish a pathway for utilizing AI models to perform advanced object tracking. Methods: Multiple crossovers by two humans will be simulated to investigate the potential of object tracking. Inspection of consistent identification will be the evidence of object tracking after crossing over. Two AI models, a fast model and an accurate model, were tested and compared with regard to their object tracking performance in 3D. Finally, the recording of pig pen was also processed with aforementioned AI model to test the possibility of 3D object detection. Results: Both AI successfully processed and provided a 3D bounding box, identification number, and distance away from camera for each individual human. The accurate detection model had better evidence than the fast detection model on 3D object tracking and showed the potential application onto pigs as a livestock. Conclusions: Preparing a custom dataset to train AI models in an appropriate farm is required for proper 3D object detection to operate object tracking for pigs at an ideal level. This will allow the farm to smoothly transit traditional methods to ASF-preventing precision livestock farming. © 2022 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The study investigated the effects of herd characteristics (breed, size, parity and study area) and husbandry practices (induced/ natural heats, flushing or not, and drying-off duration) on the fertility and fecundity rates of 721 Montbeliarde (n = 379) and Prim’Holstein (n = 342) dairy cows (DC) from 23 herds, born and bred in Algeria. Fertility parameters revealed an interval between calving and first heat of 86.8 ± 48 days, between calving and first artificial insemination (AI) of 108 ± 80.4 days, between first AI and fertilizing AI of 42.9 ± 85.2 days, between calving and fertilizing AI of 152 ± 116 days, and between calvings of 427 ± 122.8 days. A mean first AI success rate of 54.8% (DC) and 38.8 ± 20% (herd), an apparent fertility index of 1.83, and 19.3% DC inseminated three times or more (in 16.2 ± 11 of the herds) were recorded. Fertility was far from the objective. Breed had no significant effect on fertility (p > 0.05), but reproductive performance varied significantly (p < 0.05) with herd size, parity, study region, induced or natural heat, and whether or not flushing was practiced. Fecundity was lower in animals with a drying-off duration of more than 60 days (p < 0.05). Late breeding beyond 80 days postpartum was the parameter that most affected the reproductive performance of DC in the study area. © A. Haou et al., 2021.},

	abstract = {Genetic improvement of farm animals has been a prime concern over the years for researchers and animal breeders. A variety of biotechnologies have been developed and applied effectively in animal production for increasing efficiency in both dairy and meat production systems. The widespread use of such biotechnologies in animal production systems has resulted in a significant effect on genetic progress (Van Vleck, 1981). Different aspects of genetic progress may be influenced by the type of biotechnology used, such as selection accuracy, generation interval, intensity of selection, and genetic variance. In the current scenario, biotechnologies are widely used in animal production to increase not only the number of animals to satisfy global demand for animal products, but also to improve propagation and maintain current levels of biodiversity and genetic diversity for endangered species (Said et al., 2020). Biotechnologies can also help to increase animal production in a variety of ways, such as increasing the rate of reproduction of domestic animals, enhancing the quantity and quality of animal products, promoting growth and improving nutrient intake efficiency, and so on. Some assisted reproductive technologies (ART) that affect the efficiency of male and female reproduction include artificial insemination (AI), multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro fertilization (IVF), ovum pick-up (OPU), cloning, semen and embryos sexing, etc. These biotechnologies have a major impact on the dissemination of superior germplasm and the intensity of selection. Animal breeding and genetic improvement have been significantly influenced by the use of reproductive biotechnologies such as AI and embryo transfer technology. Alternatively, a secondary negative effect is that these biotechnologies can decrease genetic variation by affecting genetic variability indirectly. Because without genetic variation, there will be no opportunity for genetic change in the population. Another set of biotechnologies that is associated with quantitative or economical trait loci (QTL/ETL), their detection and use can help in determining animal genetic merit. Their key feature is that they are available early in life, therefore allowing more accurate selection. There are some novel biotechnologies are being used such as genome engineering, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, recombinant DNA technology, transgenesis, etc., which have high potential to transform DNA artificially to impact animal breeding in the future. A brief overview of the reproductive technologies and their impact on animal breeding that leads to genetic improvement is described in this chapter. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The ocean covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface, with land suitable for human purposes, especially farming, making up far less than the remaining 30%. Raising livestock takes up more than 26% of the available land on the Earth's surface and is one of the most popular, and one of the most carbon and freshwater intensive, sources of protein available (NOAA, 2020). As climate change continues to advance, and the world's population continues to grow, so does the need for protein, and aquaculture presents an ecofriendly way to feed the world. Marine aquaculture in particular has a much smaller carbon footprint, requires less land, and uses much less fresh water than traditional farming (NOAA, 2020). In many parts of the world, the growth of aquaculture industries has already aided in alleviating food insecurity, as well as providing jobs, and based on the World Bank Report, aquaculture will continue to grow rapidly and is expected to supply more than 60% of fish destined for human consumption by 2030 (World Bank, 2013). Given the importance of the industry and its rapid growth, there is a lot of space for improvements in methodology and technology to reduce cost and increase overall yield. Overfeeding in aquaculture is one of the major causes of pollution in the industry and also leads to disease, with loss of livestock and wasted feed (which increases costs). Since excess nutrients are released into the outside environment, they can also pollute the surrounding area. Feed waste can account for 25-75% of a farm's feed consumption, depending on the farming method (Lee, 2001). Increased feeding frequency, with less food being delivered per feed, has been shown to decrease this food waste. However, since feeding fish is labor intensive and expensive when done by hand, feeding frequency is often difficult to increase and dependent on the size of the farm, availability of labor, and species, with feeding frequencies ranging from once or twice per day to up to five times per day. Generally, however, higher feeding frequencies greatly increase the rate of growth for many species, while also reducing overfeeding (Lee, 2001). With feed also making up around 60% of production costs in aquaculture, reducing waste of excess food can lower costs significantly, as well as eliminate the danger of overfeeding related disease and stock loss. Automatic and on-demand feeders enable farmers to tune feed to consumption and have been effectively utilized to reduce labor costs as well as overfeeding, but they must be programmed and installed in every tank. The installation costs of these systems can be a financial barrier for many farmers. Our proposed robotic feeding system can meet the unique needs of a variety of aquatic animals while minimizing the labor required by farmers and the risk of overfeeding. The system traverses a fixed cable hung above pens or tanks and dispenses fish food according to preinstalled feeding instructions or by determining animal activity using a camera-based artificial intelligence system. Attaching the feed system to a cable suspended over the fish pens allows one system to feed multiple pens/tanks, and to disperse feed evenly throughout the tank with only a single unit. It also provides the opportunity for the system to refill itself automatically from a large, centrally located reservoir, enabling it to work autonomously for extended periods of time. This significantly reduces the labor and time investment needed in aquaculture operations, as well as allowing for optimal feed deployment and frequency with no increase in human labor. The addition of a camera and vision system to determine when the fish or other animals stop responding to feed (i.e. have been fed enough) decreases the amount of waste feed dispensed, and ensures that water quality is not compromised. This paper explores the design and testing of the robotic system, applications for its use, and recommends directions for future development.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Farming becomes smarter with automation and radio frequency technology. Radio frequency collect and manage data about crop performance, climate change, livestock welfare, resource shortages and atmosphere that frequently influence farming construction via smartphone applications where the data container remains and is retrieved wherever. It also aids in animal nursing and termination. With smart sensors and equipment, farmers can increase crop production with reduced cost and time. Smart farming along with sensors offers the guarantee of expanding efficiency while diminishing generation costs and limiting ecological effects. The sensor data will be collected and stored in the cloud. Analysis of farming is done with computing the data stored in the cloud. Based on these cloud data, farmers perform farming in a proper annual time. Cloud-based storage is more appropriate for these computations.

Quality environmental conditions, automation and monitoring are the key necessities of running a good and profitable livestock farm. Air quality, temperature of the surroundings and humidity play a major role while deciding the fan speeds of the exhaust System used in all aspects of livestock farming. Another important part of livestock production is increasing incubation speeds of eggs by performing artificial incubation. It is a requirement to maintain the temperature at a constant value in this system. This paper describes two mutually exclusive Fuzzy Logic algorithm-based systems to automate the exhaust system and an artificial egg incubator. The other important part of a livestock farm is production of milk and milk products. It is required to monitor the health of cows by overseeing their activities at any point of time. This can be done by determining and monitoring the activities performed by the cow.

	abstract = {In hydroponics [1–3] fodder [4] system, hydroponics are the plants which are grown in the absence of soil and pesticides or fertilizers, i.e., only using hydro(water). Fodder is the part of plants that is being fed to the cattle and livestock. This part is produced using temperature sensor DS18B20 which measures the temperature and give readings on the LCD display underneath the roots. The code is uploaded using USB cable to Arduino UNO. These plants require low maintenance and are low cost. The plants can be developed fully in 8–10 days. For making it conventional for traditional farmers, use of nutrient solution is not necessary, and tap water can also be used. In a country like India, wheat is the most liked and chosen grain for traditional farming, and hence, wheat is widely used to produce fodder. The fodder produced looks like 25 cm high green compromising of the whole grown plant, i.e., seeds, plants, roots, and stems. For production of about 1 kg of good quality wheat fodder, about 2–3 L of water is required, and it yields about 5–6 times of good quality fodder on regular basis. The fodder which is produced using automation hydroponics technique is more digestive and nutrient rich which also provides other dietary benefits to the cattle. From cost point of view, the price of seed compromises of about 86% of the total cost of fodder. A cow requires about 5–10 kg of dietary supplement everyday, and hence, hydroponics wheat fodder is capable of providing organic, fresh, and nutritious fodder to the cattle without any chemicals and harmful supplements. Feeding of hydroponics fodder will increase the cattle and livestocks’ digestability which will in-turn result in increased production of by-product (milk) as compared to conventional/traditional feeding methods. Therefore, fodder produced using this automated system could be used by the farmers to feed their livestock in a cost-effective manner. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Counting nursing piglets is an essential task on commercial sow farms and provides a core parameter for evaluating sow reproductive performance. As a current management practice, piglets in farrowing pens are usually manually counted by caretakers several times during and after parturition and at weaning, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often subject to careless errors. In recent years, automated counting tools based on computer vision have drawn increasing attention from the pig industry. However, piglets frequently can be occluded by farrowing stalls or sows, either fully or partially, which results in substantial counting errors by existing automated methods. To address problems caused by the partial occlusion, a two-stage center clustering network (CClusnet) was developed to improve automated piglet counting performance. We constructed a dataset consisting of 2,600 images from three farrowing pens to test and validate the CClusnet. The images were under heavy occlusions with one sow (DNA Genetics Line 241) and 7–13 piglets per image, and 97.7% of images having one or more piglets partially occluded. In the first stage, the CClusnet predicted a semantic segmentation map and a center offset vector map for each image. In the second stage, scattered center points were produced by combining the two maps, and the mean-shift algorithm was applied to determine the piglet count. The results showed that CClusnet achieved 0.43 mean absolute error per image for piglet counting, had a better performance than previous network architectures, and outperformed existing counting methods. Furthermore, our technique is a nonocclusion-specific method and can be applied in other similar settings with different types of occlusions, and with potential to achieve high accuracy in animal position detection and monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Meat and dairy products are negatively impacted by a lack of technology in the livestock industry in developing countries. To cater for this challenge, the Internet of Things (IoT), Node-MCU, and intelligent wireless sensor nodes are deployed to create a new smart dairy monitoring system. A cow collar with a temperature sensor, a GPS module, and an environmental parameter regularization system are included. Data from modules is stored in a separate database using an innovative IoT -based front end. All the deployed WS nodes can determine whether the environment is stable or not at any given time. Sensors built inside cow collars can assess vital indications like temperature and pulse rate, as well as the animal's exact location. The design of the Cow collar also has a feature that automatically alerts the owner. The plug-and-play technology offered is designed to be easy to adapt. When a farm has many animals, automation decreases the need for human involvement and so lowers labor expenses. The exploitation of remote monitoring systems improves the health of the animals and hence yields a better amount of dairy. This study also includes a detailed comparison of the proposed implementation with current systems to demonstrate its originality. Other applications, such as smart monitoring of zoo animals and poultry, may be derived from the proposed technology. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The processing of livestock leading to meat products fit for human consumption is an activity where hygiene and performance standards are rigorously and continually monitored. According to the Australian Export meat Inspection System (AEMIS), such monitoring is, in part, the responsibility of an onplant veterinarian (OPV) who conducts antemortem inspection as well as verification of post-mortem inspection and processor hygiene practices [of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry, 2021] . Failing to conduct a livestock antemortem inspection (LAMI) "on-time", due to the lack or absence of an OPV, can pose extreme health and safety risks for consumers and financial risks to the meat industry. To address the impact of failure of an OPV to be able to conduct a LAMI, a vet-assistive technology which can modularize the inspection process and enable offline and remote inspections is highly desirable. This work presents the initial step towards building the vet-assistive technology by focusing on capturing sufficient information, for example monitoring the gait cycle and step count of an animal [Chapinal et al., 2009], to facilitate decisions about the overall health of the animal. To this end, pose estimation based on a deep neural network is first employed for estimating the cattle kinetics (i.e., movement behaviours and gait) in a short video. Then, a peak-finding algorithm is applied for counting the number of steps taken by the cattle. Preliminary results revealed that the proposed method can effectively count the number of steps with mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.72 and 0.86 solely based on the kinematics of front carpal joints and coffin joints, respectively. © 2022 Australasian Robotics and Automation Association.

	abstract = {[Purpose/Significance] The livestock and poultry industry in China is in an important period of accelerating transformation. Understanding the research status of the related technology has certain reference significance for the development of the livestock and poultry industry. [Method/Process] This paper takes three main directions of the technology in the field of livestock and poultry farming facilities, cage, feeding and environment control, as the research object, and uses patentometrics to analyze the development trend, technology branch, applicant and key patents at all stages. [Results/Conclusions] The development of cage, feeding and environment control technology has experienced three stages simultaneously: germination stage, fluctuating development stage and rapid development stage, and the current application volume is on the rise in a straight line. Technology applications in this field mainly come from enterprises, and there are obvious differences in technology layout among enterprises. In recent years, the number of key patents from China has increased significantly. The research on cage technology devices is focused on technologies such as excrement and urine removal and floor covering. Research on feeding is more than that on drinking water, and both focus on automation equipment. Environment control focuses on waste treatment, air conditioning and house cleaning and scrubbing. © 2021 The authors.},

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI) with incorrectly selected spermatozoa accounts for a significant loss to the farmers and the dairy industry. Therefore, accurate prediction of male fertility is of major economic value, especially in a farm set-up. To maximize the efficiency of modern livestock systems, novel ways to ascertain the fertilizing ability of the spermatozoa are required. Numerous factors are known to govern the male fertility; however, the sugars (glycans) on the sperm surface are emerging as a novel and key factor regulating various aspects of the sperm fertilizing ability. A highly specialized epithelial cell, the mammalian spermatozoon is embellished with a rich array of functionally diverse and structurally complex glycans that manifest as a thick glycocalyx. These glycans which are often conjugated either to lipids or proteins exist as glycoconjugates (GCs) apart from their independent existence on the sperm surface. The glycans in the glycocalyx of mammalian spermatozoa are multifunctional molecules which perform reproduction-specific tasks such as cervical mucus penetration, communication with various cells in the female reproductive tract (FRT), and recognition of the oocyte, etc. The testicular spermatozoa only have a rudimentary glycocalyx which, however, is substantially transformed in thickness, composition, and structure during the epididymal sperm-surface remodeling (SSR) events. The sugars in the sperm glycocalyx have been proposed to exist in a specific three-dimensional conformation termed as Sperm Associated Glyco-Topography (SpAGT). This topography of glycans is recognized and presumably interpreted by the patterns recognition receptors (PRRs) on the female immune cells, e.g. neutrophils. The glycans in the sperm glycocalyx are known to interact with various inhibitory receptors on these cells which facilitate sperm survival in the FRT. Nevertheless, to decode the information about survival in the sperm glycome, the identity, valence, linkage, attachment sites, and structures of the individual sugar units in the sperm glycocalyx need to be determined. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

Due to limitation of land, water, and other natural resources, farming by manual processes may face challenges in near future. It is thus the need of the hour to find alternatives that will help to accomplish greater productivity and return in farming. Through the fourth industrial revolution, we are already in the age of digital technologies and computers and high-speed internet; tab and smart phone are now the most common modern technologies. Several advanced technologies such as computer programming, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), cloud computing, big data analysis, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Drone technology, and Robotics have already transformed our everyday life with greater gains and efficiencies. These technologies have already reached real farms from research labs. The livestock farm industry is now the hotspot for the application of these advanced technologies to monitor farm animals in real-time basis, optimize food intake, predict diseases, and improve animal health. Digitalization has made possible shifting of agriculture from input-intensive to knowledge-intensive system. There are many digital technologies for smart and precision livestock farming. However, the question puts forward which digital technologies could presently be practiced in the management and operations of livestock farm. Of particular interest is to illustrate advanced digital technologies available for use rationally to achieve greater efficiencies in livestock farming and make livestock enterprise profitable. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022, Corrected Publication 2022.},

	abstract = {The ease of use and advancements in drone technology is resulting in the widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to diverse fields, making it a booming technology. Among UAVs' several applications, livestock agriculture is one of the most promising, where UAVs facilitate various operations for efficient animal management. But the field is characterized by multiple environmental, technical, economic, and strategic challenges. However, the use of advanced technological techniques like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), advanced sensors, etc., along with the assurance of animal welfare while operating the UAVs, can lead to widespread adoption of drone technology amongst livestock farmers. This paper discusses livestock management research where UAVs monitor farm animals via detection, counting, tracking animals, etc. In this article, an attempt has been made to elucidate different aspects and broader issues around livestock management while highlighting the associated challenges, opportunities, and prospects. This work is the first review paper on the subject matter with all the necessary information and analysis, to the best of our knowledge.

	abstract = {Asia contributes significantly to world’s duck population. Asian countries like China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Bangladesh have a high number of ducks. Cambodia is the duck predominant country with a share of 40.5% ducks in total poultry, while Bangladesh is the most duck dense country in the world with 438.8 ducks per square kilometer area. The world duck population increased by sixfold from 193.4 million heads in 1961 to 1177.4 million heads in 2019. The growth curve has three phases: a slow and steady early growth from 1961 to 1985 with annual growth rate (AGR) of 5.0%, a fast growth phase from 1985 to 2010 (AGR = 7.3%), and a stationary phase from 2010 onwards with AGR of −0.17%. The first human death due to avian influenza (AI) in Hong Kong in 1997, reemergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in 2003 and spreading to new territories in 2007 caused significant slumps in duck production. France ranks second in duck meat production after China, although it holds seventh position in duck population. Nearly 80% of the down and feathers are produced in China. Out of the total 195.6 million kilos of duck meat exported in 2019, 71% emanated from Europe. The per capita availability of duck meat was high in European countries like Hungary (9570 g) and France (3460 g). Apart, Europe is the major exporter of live birds, with France alone contributing more than half. During the recent 5 years, the reduction of human cases of AI has signaled the revival of duck farming. Location-specific technological interventions are to be carried out to refine the existing practices and to sustain duck farming. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the different techniques used to monitor the respiration and sounds of livestock. Livestock respiration is commonly assessed visually by observing abdomen fluctuation; however, the traditional methods are time consuming, subjective, being therefore impractical for large-scale operations and must rely on automation. Contact and non-contact technologies are used to automatically monitor respiration rate; contact technologies (e.g., accelerometers, pressure sensors, and thermistors) utilize sensors that are physically mounted on livestock while non-contact technologies (e.g., computer vision, thermography, and sound analysis) enable a non-invasive method of monitoring respiration. This work summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of contact and non-contact technologies and discusses the emerging role of non-contact sensors in automating monitoring for large-scale farming operations. This work is the first in-depth examination of automated monitoring technologies for livestock respiratory diseases; the findings and recommendations are important for livestock researchers and practitioners who can gain a better understanding of these different technologies, especially emerging non-contact sensing.

	abstract = {Precision livestock farming promises substantial advantages in terms of animal welfare, product quality and reducing methane emissions, but requires continuous and reliable data on the animal's behavior. While systems suitable for use within the barn exist, grazing over long distances poses challenges. Here, we address this issue by proposing an ultra low-power Edge AI device, minimizing data transmission requirements and potentially improving accuracy as compared to classification-based solutions. Namely, we propose cow behavior distribution regression with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), dubbed TinyCowNet, to estimate mixed-label sample spaces. Without quantization, the random search to minimize resources and maximize accuracy shows networks requiring a memory of 76kB on average and offering an accuracy up to 95.7%. These are implementable on a wide range of low-power Micro Controller Units (MCU) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). Furthermore, our proposed post-training full-integer quantization for RNNs combined with power estimation on 45nm CMOS using experimental literature shows a TinyCowNet occupying a memory around $\approx 2$ kB, having a hypothetical power consumption on the order of 200nW, delivering an accuracy of 95.2% and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.86. This work paves the way for the future creation of low-cost, highly accurate cow behavior estimation devices with long battery life that reduce the entry barriers currently hindering precision livestock farming outside the barn.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Our purpose is to design a system for Quick Quality analysis of cereals, pulses, and grains using Artificial Intelligence implementing hardware and software technologies, which could swiftly analyze the type and quality of bulk grains without human intervention. Our aim is detecting and image processing to assess the grain's quality, which is also used as food for livestock, that is an important problem since high food quality has a great impact on animal health, overcoming the limitations of prior work in this field. In our methodology, the complete grain is analyzed to determine its quality by placing it in a controlled environment with a 13 Megapixel, 4K Camera Module to perform the initial step for image processing procedures, before implementing a Neural network. Surpassing the hurdles of samples to estimate the quality of the complete grains, we demonstrated a full-grain scan technique, resulting in a unique hardware system that can more efficiently estimate the quality of the entire grains. Furthermore, our technology yields faster results since it captures the moving grains on the conveyor belt using a precise, fast camera module, which is analyzed by expeditious NVidia Jetson Nano. We applied automation in every step of this process by using vacuum tubes to collect the grains, a filter to align them, conveyor belt with a variable notch for optimum grain disposal. In summary, our study describes innovative developments stemming from a system that provides proper analysis of bulk grains, cereals, and pulses as well as automation of the system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The largest cause of reproductive loss is that the animal fails to become pregnant at a specified interval and/or during the breeding season. Heifers and cows fail to become pregnant, because they do not show estrus (heat) or fail to conceive after showing estrus. The widely accepted techniques like artificial insemination (AI) and estrous cycle synchronization in cattle is a proof of concept that how discoveries in basic science can revolutionize livestock breeding and management. The discovery of ovarian steroids and its potential application through an elaborate research and clinical trial have led to development of methods to control estrous cycle and ovulation in cattle. Controlled breeding results in numerous advantages, which includes elimination of labor-intensive estrus detection at herd level, effective utilization of resources by planned breeding in a short duration of time, reduction in breeding season, production of calf and replacement heifers of same-age group, maximizing the utilization of genetically superior bull through widest coverage of cows through AI. Developing a clear and thorough understanding of the estrous cycle, endocrine control, estrous signs and detection aids, and application of this knowledge in day-to-day clinical practice will not only allow the veterinarian to optimize the reproductive efficiency but also for successful use of estrous synchronization and other reproductive technologies in cattle.

The FAO estimates that wildfires result in at least USD 1 billion in agriculture-related losses due to the destruction of livestock pasture, destruction of agricultural buildings, premature death of farm animals, and general disruption of agricultural activities. Even though artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference systems (AN-FISs), among others, have proven useful in fire prevention, their application is limited in real farm environments. Most farms rely on traditional/non-technology-based methods of fire prevention. The case for AI in agricultural fire prevention is grounded on the accuracy and reliability of computer simulations in smoke movement analysis, risk assessment, and postfire analysis. In addition, such technologies can be coupled with next-generation fire-retardant materials such as intumescent coatings with a polymer binder, blowing agent, carbon donor, and acid donor. Future prospects for AI in agriculture transcend basic fire safety to encompass Society 5.0, energy systems in smart cities, UAV monitoring, Agriculture 4.0, and decentralized energy. However, critical challenges must be overcome, including the health and safety aspects, cost, and reliability. In brief, AI offers un-limited potential in the prevention of fire hazards in farms, but the existing body of knowledge is inadequate. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Whether for contaminant detection or automatic cutting, multimodal perception systems, in particular, based on hyperspectral imaging have the ability to provide information that goes beyond the texture and colour of a surface. In this paper, we present a learning-based method to estimate subcutaneous fat depth in meat cuts by leveraging hyperspectral data models that rely on the knowledge of modelled light sources and surface shape information. Data from a fully calibrated hyperspectral and colour depth (RGB-D) camera system is used as input. Fat depth ground truth is recovered via a novel systematic approach that ray casts a computed tomography (CT) mesh of the meat cuts, which is nonrigidly aligned with a depth reconstruction captured by the RGB-D camera. We thus evaluate machine learning methods that can handle small datasets, by employing dimensionality reduction and data augmentation to address the limited amount of imbalanced data that is acquired. Our results show that leveraging shape and light models, coupled with machine learning methods that capture nonlinearities and spatial correlations produces the most accurate results. © 2022 Australasian Robotics and Automation Association.

	abstract = {The food shortage and the population growth are the most challenges facing sustainable development worldwide. Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the mobile internet can provide realistic solutions to the challenges that are facing the world. Therefore, this work focuses on the new approaches regarding smart farming (SF) from 2019 to 2021, where the work illustrates the data gathering, transmission, storage, analysis, and also, suitable solutions. IoT is one of the essential pillars in smart systems, as it connects sensor devices to perform various basic tasks. The smart irrigation system included those sensors for monitoring water level, irrigation efficiency, climate, etc. Smart irrigation is based on smart controllers and sensors as well as some mathematical relations. In addition, this work illustrated the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and robots, where they can be achieved several functions such as harvesting, seedling, weed detection, irrigation, spraying of agricultural pests, livestock applications, etc. real-time using IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML) and wireless communications. Moreover, this work demonstrates the importance of using a 5G mobile network in developing smart systems, as it leads to high-speed data transfer, up to 20 Gbps, and can link a large number of devices per square kilometer. Although the applications of smart farming in developing countries are facing several challenges, this work highlighted some approaches the smart farming. In addition, the implementation of Smart Decision Support Systems (SDSS) in developing countries supports the real-time analysis, mapping of soil characteristics and also helps to make proper decision management. Finally, smart agriculture in developing countries needs more support from governments at the small farms and the private sector. © 2021},

	abstract = {The increasing popularity of automated systems and the increased market share of producers of robotic feeding equipment for cows causes the need for a deeper study of energy demand in such technologies. This article provides an analysis of the inputs of energy accumulated in conventional (CFS) and automated feeding systems (AFS) for cattle. The aim of this is to determine the impact of robotic technologies for the preparation and feeding of fodder on the cumulative energy inputs. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of machinery and the equipment applied to the cumulative energy intensity in cattle farming facilities. The cumulative energy consumption for four technologies of automated cattle feeding (AFS) was tested and compared to the energy consumption for six technologies with a conventional feeding system (CFS). The research involved nine cow barn facilities for dairy cows and one for beef cattle. An evaluation has been made for cattle farming structures (milk and meat production) with various mixing and feeding systems for feeds of various concentrations, and keeping system (tied system and free-stall). The cow barns differed in feed mixing, feeding machinery, and equipment. Measurements of live labor inputs and the consumption of electric and mechanical energy carriers were carried out, and the mass of various types of machines and devices with software was taken into account, which became the basis for calculating cumulative energy consumption for individual technologies. The obtained average of electric and mechanical energy inputs for robotic technologies of feeding fodder (AFS) was 0.60025 kWh·day−1·LU−1 (where LU means Large Animal Unit 500 kg), and it was 39.3% lower than for conventional technologies (CFS) where it was 0.989052 kWh·day−1·LU−1 . However, taking into account all components of cumulative energy consumption, the average for the group of robotic technologies (AFS) was higher by 35.18% than for conventional technologies (CFS). © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Identification of relevant in vivo biomarkers for fertility remains a challenge for the livestock industry. Concentrations of the small peptide hormone oxytocin (OXT), involved in male reproductive function and present in the seminal plasma (SP) of several species could be a robust one. This study characterized concentrations of SP-OXT in ejaculates from boars used in artificial insemination (AI) programs aiming to evaluate its relationship with sperm quality variables and in vivo fertility of their liquid-stored AI-semen. Seminal OXT concentrations (ng/mL) were measured in 169 ejaculates from 61 boars of the Duroc, Pietrain, Landrace and Large White breeds using a direct competitive immunoassay test based on AlphaLISA® technology. Ejaculate (ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count) and sperm parameters (motility, viability, intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, plasma membrane fluidity) were assessed at 0 h and 72 h in AI-semen samples stored at 17 °C. In vivo fertility included only 18 Large White and Landrace boars whose AI-semen was used to inseminated > 100 sows and evaluated both farrowing rate and litter size of 3,167 sows. Results: The results showed that SP-OXT differed between boars and between ejaculates within boar (P < 0.05) but not between breeds (Duroc, Pietrain, Landrace and Large White). Ejaculates with higher SP-OXT concentration/mL (hierarchically grouped; P < 0.001) had larger volume and came from younger boars (P < 0.05). Ejaculates of boars showing positive farrowing rate deviation exhibited higher (P < 0.05) SP-OXT concentration/mL than those with negative farrowing rate deviation. Conclusion: The SP concentrations of OXT are boar, ejaculate and age dependent, and positively related with ejaculate volume and farrowing rates of liquid-stored semen AI-doses. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Creating and maintaining the microclimate in livestock buildings is associated with numerous engineering and technical challenges. Together with adequate feeding, the microclimate determines the health, reproductive ability, and production potential of the animals (obtaining a maximum amount of high-quality products). One of the deciding steps in improving the parameters of microclimate, i.e., temperature and humidity in agricultural facilities, particularly in livestock buildings, is to develop reliable and highly efficient air curtains in the vestibules. The objective of the manuscript is to investigate the parameters of the microclimate in livestock buildings using the air curtain, supported by automation and ICT technologies for rational operating modes. The presented theoretical and experimental studies on improving the microclimate parameters in livestock buildings were carried out using an innovative air curtain system. Its power is calculated based on the dimensions of the room, and the flow rate of warm air near the floor level is three times lower than at the installation site. The use of air curtains reduces consumption of thermal energy needed to maintain an optimal microclimate for livestock by 10–15%. Furthermore, the use of an automated digital control system maintains an optimal microclimate in the building. The developed energy-saving system for creating an optimal micro-climate in livestock buildings using air curtains was tested in a pigsty of the Research and Training Farm “Vorzel” of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine, located in the Kiev region. The developed automated microclimate system using air curtains significantly improves the microclimate parameters and significantly reduces power consumption. The system can be further developed by adding remote control based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding the phenotypic and genetic parameter estimates of growth traits is important for an effective livestock genetic improvement programme. Objectives: In this study, we evaluated the phenotypic performances and estimated genetic parameters for birthweight (BWT), weaning weight (WWT), pre-weaning average daily gain (PADG), pre-weaning Kleiber ratio (PKR), pre-weaning growth efficiency (PGE) and pre-weaning relative growth rate (PRGR) of Fogera cattle in Ethiopia. Methods: Growth data collected from 2000 to 2018 in Andassa Livestock Research Center were used for the study. General linear model of SAS 9.1 was used to estimate the least squares mean (LSM) ± standard error (SE) for phenotypic performances, and AI-REML of Wombat software combined with a series of five single-trait animal models to estimate phenotypic variance and its direct, maternal and residual components. Calf sex, calf birth season and calf birth year were the fixed effects considered. Results: The overall LSM ± SE BWT, WWT, PADG, PKR, PGE and PRGR were 21.28 ± 0.05 kg, 97.99 ± 0.67 kg, 320.29 ± 2.79 g, 10.10 ± 0.04, 3.51 ± 0.35 and 1.95 ± 0.00, respectively. All the fixed effects considered significantly (p < 0.001) affected all the traits. The direct heritability estimates for BWT, WWT, PADG, PKR, PGE and PRGR were 0.21 ± 0.07, 0.26 ± 0.01, 0.55 ± 0.19, 0.53 ± 0.18, 0.33 ± 0.00 and 0.50 ± 0.00, respectively. The genetic correlations among the traits ranged from negative (−0.20 ± 0.04; BWT-PKR) to positive (0.99 ± 0.00; BW-PGE, BW-GR, WWT-PGE, WWT-PGR, ADG-PGR, PKR-PGR, PKR-PGE and PGE-PGR). Similarly, the phenotypic correlations ranged from −0.03 ± 0.20 to 0.99 ± 0.01; BWT-PGE, BWT-PRGR, WWT-PGE, WWT-PRGR, PKR-PGE, PKR-PRGR and PGE-PRGR). Conclusion: The positive and larger phenotypic and genetic correlations between most of the traits implied that selection based on one trait could improve the other traits. However, the negative phenotypic and genetic correlation between BWT-PKRA implies that selection of Fogera calves based on either of the traits has an adverse effect on the other. Therefore, caution should be taken when designing the selection criteria for growth improvement. © 2021 The Authors. Veterinary Medicine and Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The overall repeatability and precision of the developed system was evaluated and compared with the manual gas measurement technique in respect to characterization of the fermentation kinetics of ruminant livestock feeds. Two incubations were carried out, during which the GP of six different feeds was measured with the automated system or manual technique. During a 48-hour incubation period, pressure data were collected at 15-minute intervals using automated equipment, yielding 192 head-space pressure measurements for each bottle. In manual measurement, incubations were performed with the nominal 60-mL serum bottle, and headspace pressure was read using a digital pressure gauge and then released at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hours of incubation. The automated equipment recorded greater GP (+11.5%, over the 48-h incubation) than the manual measurement, and the repeatability and coefficient of repeatability values indicated that the GP data obtained with manual equipment were less repeatable. The automated equipment measures the fermentative GP kinetics with greater precision and repeatability than manual technique. • An automated batch GP equipment was designed, developed and validated, and a comparison was made with GP data obtained manually using a digital pressure gauge. • The automated equipment provided more reliable and repeatable data compared with manual measurement. • The automated equipment is available with lower cost and more functionality. © 2022},

This has been accomplished with difficulty and over a number of decades, and its full exploitation is still undergoing. In addition, when thinking on the application of the most recent reproductive technologies in the buffalo, the thought must go to the two subspecies considered, the river and the swamp type, and their different countries of origin, environment and production expectations. The idea of enhancing the yearly genetic gain and the management of buffalo farms through the use, more recently, of sexed semen has gained attention from the most competitive farms and livestock entrepreneurs. In this chapter, a review on the early attempts and recent developments in the use of sexed semen in the buffalo species will be given, together with an outlook on the possible scenarios deriving from the full exploitation of this technology. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

	abstract = {Technological change has been a constant feature of livestock systems leading to the third agricultural ‘green’ revolution of the mid-20th century. Digital technologies are now leading us into the fourth agricultural revolution, where sustainable food production is supported by technologies that collect data useful for farm and supply chain performance improvement, along with task automation and compliance. However, the potential benefits of digital agricultural futures are uncertain and plagued by unrealized expectations of previous innovations. The aims of this paper are to articulate current trends in technology and livestock systems and anticipate future trajectories for Agriculture 4.0 in relation to meeting sustainability and animal welfare outcomes for livestock systems. We use a ‘Futures Triangle’ approach to review the role of technology in livestock systems. The main findings are that previous work envisioning technological livestock futures have favoured pull of the future factors (techno-optimists) or weight of the past (techno-pessimists), rather than a balance of pull, push and weighting factors. Responsible Agriculture 4.0 innovation requires public–private collaboration of innovation system stakeholders, including policy makers, farmers, consumers, as well as technology developers, to enable development of transition pathways from a systems perspective. The use of responsible innovation processes, including anticipation on alternative futures, should also be built into innovation processes to support critical reflection on technological trajectories and related innovation system consequences, both desirable and undesirable. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {A prominent conflict observed between growing masses and wildlife in India. Few of the major consequences are: Injury, loss of life, damage to human property, crop damage, destruction of human habitats and many more. Adaption of temporary solutions like electric fences, trenches, manual surveillance, guard dogs, etc. are used to protect the habitat but are not economic and proven to stay as an unsafe solution for wildlife as well the humans. In order to initiate safety for both wild animals and humans, some mitigation plan is required to solve this issue. While there are various IoT-based Animal Surveillance and repellent systems in market, a touch of Artificial Intelligence can make it more reliable and efficient. This will certainly push forward the bars that are kept limited with the use of IoT alone. The proposed system aims in protecting human habitation and livestock at the outskirts of the forest area/ fields by developing an automated system that detects the intrusion of wild animals and repels them back to the forest without causing any harm; Hence minimizing the dangerous consequences caused by the Human-Wildlife conflict.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Semi-domesticated reindeer represent an important livestock industry and livelihood for a proportion of the human population in northern Fennoscandia. Reindeer husbandry is considered an extensive animal husbandry, where the animals are kept mostly on natural pastures, although sometimes kept in fenced areas for shorter periods. These reindeer may harbour a variety of parasites that may affect animal health and production. The relatively limited close contact between herds and owners gives limited opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of diseases in general. Furthermore, the effects of subclinical parasitism in livestock are commonly expressed as a reduction in productivity rather than clinical disease and mortality. Thus, specific knowledge of endoparasites and parasitic infections in these herds is scarce. This study investigated the occurrence of various endoparasites in reindeer by analysis of a total of 114 faecal samples from winter-slaughtered reindeer from two different grazing areas in Troms and Finnmark, Norway. Results: Using a McMaster method, a Baermann technique, and a direct immunofluorescent antibody test, the following parasites were identified in the faecal samples with the occurrence data given as percentages: Strongylid eggs (62%), Nematodirinae spp. eggs (24%), Capillaria sp. eggs (42%) and Moniezia spp. eggs (17%), Dictyocaulus spp. larvae (14%) protostrongylid larvae (40%), Eimera spp. oocysts (23%), and Giardia duodenalis cysts (5%). Cryptosporidium oocysts were not detected. Parasite eggs, oocysts, and cysts were quantified. Molecular analysis revealed G. duodenalis sub-assemblage AI, a potentially zoonotic genotype not previously reported in reindeer from this region. Morphological analyses of Eimeria oocysts identified two species, Eimeria mayeri and Eimeria rangiferis, and molecular analyses of the cytochrome C oxidase I (coi) gene and 18 s rRNA (18SSU) gene of Eimeria confirmed the presence of Eimeria species that are specific to reindeer. Conclusions: A high prevalence, but low burden, of endoparasites was detected in samples from these semi-domesticated reindeer. The samples were collected during winter, when adult gastrointestinal parasites usually produce only low numbers of transmission stages. Therefore, together with the low number of samples, detailed and definitive conclusions regarding parasite status of semi-domesticated reindeer are avoided. Nevertheless, these data provide a snapshot overview of parasite occurrence in a semi-domesticated animal group vulnerable to the various environmental changes to which they are exposed. © 2021, The Author(s).},

To ensure cattle disease detection at an early stage and identify the health status of cattle, we collected the environment temperature, humidity, illuminance, and infrared images of cattle in an actual-life environment as input parameters to develop an artificial intelligence characterization module for measuring deep body temperature in a contactless manner. By analyzing the correlation of estimating deep body temperature at the horn, eyeball, and nose of cattle, the most effective way of estimating this temperature was found to be at the horn. The estimation accuracy was particularly high in the sitting state. Moreover, we proposed a noncontact measurement system that can approximately measure the moving distance of cattle and depict the cattle movement trajectory. The usability and reliability of the proposed systems were verified via an experiment using special feed. We used moving distance data as an additional input for the body temperature estimation system and found that rumen temperature can be accurately estimated. The body temperature estimated using the proposed system can be used to realize long-term remote monitoring of cattle health and early and timely abnormality detection. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {While fully automated livestock production may be considered the ultimate goal for optimising productivity at the farm level, the benefits and costs of such a development at the scale at which it needs to be implemented must also be considered from social and ethical perspectives. Automation resulting from Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) could alter fundamental views of human-animal interactions on farm and, even further, potentially compromise human and animal welfare and health if PLF development does not include a flexible, holistic strategy for integration. To investigate topic segregation, inclusion of socio-ethical aspects, and consideration of human-animal interactions within the PLF research field, the abstracts from 644 peer-reviewed publications were analysed using the recent advances in the Natural Language Processing (NLP). Two Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) probabilistic models with varying number of topics (13 and 3 for Model 1 and Model 2, respectively) were implemented to create a generalised research topic overview. The visual representation of topics produced by LDA Model 1 and Model 2 revealed prominent similarities in the terms contributing to each topic, with only weight for each term being different. The majority of terms for both models were process-oriented, obscuring the inclusion of social and ethical angles in PLF publications. A subset of articles (5%, n = 32) was randomly selected for manual examination of the full text to evaluate whether abstract text and focus reflected that of the article as a whole. Few of these articles (12.5%, n = 4) focused specifically on broader ethical or societal considerations of PLF or (9.4%, n = 3) discussed PLF with respect to human-animal interactions. While there was consideration of the impact of PLF on animal welfare and farmers in nearly half of the full texts examined (46.9%, n = 15), this was often limited to a few statements in passing. Further, these statements were typically general rather than specific and presented PLF as beneficial to human users and animal recipients. To develop PLF that is in keeping with the ethical values and societal concerns of the public and consumers, projects, and publications that deliberately combine social context with technological processes and results are needed.

The article develops the methodology of analysis and uses statistical analysis, probability theory, and generally scientific methods of knowledge. The study brings evidence of the leading hypotheses proposed and the table in the “problem-solution” format. It is proved that the agriculture of Ukraine has a heavy influence on the economy and employment. Agriculture is characterised by instability, low wages, and increased land for growing plant products, while livestock farming is in decline. The following methods are used to solve the problems: market transformation on finished food-product, diversification of production, de-shadowing of the sector, agriculture automation increase, land reform controlling, stimulating farming state programmes. The originality of this study lies in the authors’ sustainable development analysis methodology through the agricultural sector growth.

	abstract = {To explore the effects of the automated and intelligent operation of livestock breeding wastewater treatment facilities, a large-scale farm wastewater treatment facility with a daily production of 250 m3 of wastewater was investigated in this study. This wastewater treatment facility was equipped with a video surveillance system and online monitoring equipment. It was also equipped with early warning and forecasting functions to show the effect of the automated and intelligent operations. It was found that the sludge concentration, DO, and pH values were all controlled within a reasonable range of 4 000~7 000 mg·L-1, 1.5 mg·L-1（first-stage aerobic tank）and 3~5 mg·L-1 （second-stage aerobic tank）, and 6.5~8.5, respectively. The concentrations of COD and ammonia nitrogen in the effluent of the two-stage AO treatment tank were all up to the standard concentrations, that was, lower than 70 mg·L-1 and 10 mg·L-1, respectively. This showed that the automated operation of the facility was stable and that the facility could effectively treat wastewater from breeding farms. Through functions such as video monitoring, online monitoring, early warning, and forecasting, the operation status of each wastewater treatment stage could be effectively monitored to detect and solve potential issues on time, thereby improving the efficiency of the facility operation and reducing the input of operators to reduce operating expenses. The actual operation results showed that implementing automation and intelligence in wastewater treatment facilities can effectively improve the overall operation and efficiency, avoid environmental risks to the greatest extent, and reduce operating costs. © 2021 Editorial Board of Journal of Agro-Environment Science.

This study was using a completely randomized design (CRD) with three different incubation time treatments; 25 (T1), 30 (T2) and 35 minutes (T3) with three replications. T0 was used fresh semen as a control without incubation time. The variables measured in this study were the motility and concentration of the sperms before and after sexing. The results of this study showed that the incubation time did not affecting the sperms motility and concentration (P> 0.05). However, motility of the X sexed sperms in T2 is likely higher than in T1 and T3. Contrary, motility of Y sexed sperms in T1 had higher than in T2 and T3. It can be concluded that the incubation time during separation of X and Y sperms using egg albumin sedimentation had no significant effect on sperms motility and concentration. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In Ethiopia, small ruminant breeding programs has been shifted from central nucleus scheme to community based breeding programs considering the past genetic improvement approaches and their suitability to the Ethiopia's production system. One-tier community-based breeding program (CBBP) is currently active breeding strategy implementing with farmers having a common interest to improve and share their genetic resources. Reviewing the progressive results and faced obstacles with their possible solutions is crucial to the breeding plan for its strengthening and adoption in non-participantareas/breeds and other commodities. Community based breeding program has been operated successfully in smallholder goat/sheep producers in mixed crop livestock production system. However, in pastoral and agro-pastoral communities and farmers that have larger flock sizes even in the mixed production system are resisted because of restricted freedom in flock movement, fear of losing independency in decision making and lack of interest in mixing their own flock with others. Moreover, the progressive results of CBBP's are significantly different among sites due to the differences in commitment and relationship among the CBBP implementers as well as the regional governmental services. Expanding of the CBBP's in the existing sites as well as in new sites/breeds is still in the gradual form. Small flock sizes, uncontrolled mating system, difficulty of pedigree and performance recording, year round lambing/kidding pattern, keeping higher proportion of breeding males than the recommended male to female ratio, poor institutional support, weak organization of farmers’, incompatible cooperative society proclamation to the CBBP, shortage of incentives to participant farmers are identified as main challenges of the CBBP. Thus, strengthening and careful implementation of CBBP bylaws, reconsidering the cooperative society proclamation and government services is crucial to improve productivity of small ruminant and thereby the profits of farmers in the CBBP's. Applying restricted breeding season may create great opportunity to increase availability of candidate breeding ram/buck and to eliminate correction factor for kid/lamb season of birth. Optimizing the number of CBBP's per targeted breed is essential to obtain better genetic gain via efficient utilization of skilled manpower that engage in the CBBP's rather than gradual increments of CBBP's. Capacitating the existing reproductive technologies like AI and estrus synchronization (ES) in the CBBP is essential foraccelerate genetic gain, to record accurate pedigree information, and to disseminate the superior gene into non participant farmers. Designing and implementing compatible breeding strategy that initiate individual farmers with larger flock size in the pastoral, agro-pastoral as well as in the mixed production systems may achieve higher genetic gain, profit and sustainability of the proramme. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections can negatively impact livestock health and reduce productivity, and some species and genotypes infecting livestock have zoonotic potential. Infection occurs via the faecal-oral route. Waterborne infections are a recognised source of infection for humans, but the role of livestock drinking water as a source of infection in livestock has not been described. This study aimed to determine whether contaminated drinking water supplies, such as farm dams, are a likely transmission source for Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections for extensively managed sheep. Dam water samples (n = 47) were collected during autumn, winter and spring from 12 farm dams located on six different farms in south west Western Australia, and faecal samples (n = 349) were collected from sheep with access to these dams. All samples were initially screened for Cryptosporidium spp. at the 18S locus and Giardia spp. at the gdh gene using qPCR, and oocyst numbers were determined directly from the qPCR data using DNA standards calibrated by droplet digital PCR. Cryptosporidium-positive sheep faecal samples were typed and subtyped by sequence analysis of 18S and gp60 loci, respectively. Giardia-specific PCR and Sanger sequencing targeting tpi and gdh loci were performed on Giardia- positive sheep faecal samples to characterise Giardia duodenalis assemblages. To identify Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. in dam water samples, next-generation sequencing analysis of 18S and gdh amplicons were performed, respectively. Two species of Cryptosporidium (Cryptosporidium xiaoi and Cryptospordium ubiquitum (subtype family XIIa)) were detected in 38/345 sheep faecal samples, and in water from 9/12 farm dams during the study period, with C. xiaoi the species most frequently detected in both faeces and dam water overall. Giardia duodenalis assemblages AI, AII and E were detected in 36/348 faecal samples and water from 10/12 farm dams. For dam water samples where oo/cysts were detected by qPCR, Cryptosporidium oocyst concentration ranged from 518–2429 oocysts/L (n = 14), and Giardia cyst concentration ranged from 102 to 1077 cysts/L (n = 17). Cryptosporidium and Giardia with zoonotic potential were detected in farm dam water, including C. ubiquitum, C. hominis, C. parvum, C. cuniculus, C. xiaoi, and G. duodenalis assemblages A, B and E. The findings suggest that dam water can be contaminated with Cryptosporidium species and G. duodenalis assemblages that may infect sheep and with zoonotic potential, and farm dam water may represent one source of transmission for infections. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainability. Two words not commonly used in the context of crop rotation management. However, simple AI-based expert systems supporting farms' decision-making for optimizing crop rotation might be the key to solving most of the UN sustainable development goals worldwide. The essence of AI-based crop rotation and farm management is that it works with nature-not against it! Thus, the AI -based expert system needs to solve the multidimensional optimization tasks of maximizing the diversity of crops that match the local soil, local climate condition, the needs of the livestock, and any available machinery. Next to the option task, the expert system had to argue its decision-making basis since the goal is to get the most sustainable farming with the most profitable crop yield, not to get the largest yield. The expert systems' user interface (UI) should broaden thinking habits, opting for new sustainable farming perspectives. This paper will introduce both the technical architecture and the user-in-the-loop (UIL) principle of such an expert system. Since our system is still in the conceptional phase, we argue design decisions and address open research questions needed to implement such an expert system.  © 2021 IEEE.},

The customized mechanical design and the force measuring feature allow safe grasping, holding, stretching and moving of the slippery and easily torn tissues. The paper describes how a sensor-enabled, smart version of the gripper was engineered.

	abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB), a fungus disease of small grain cereal crops, results in reduced yields and diminished value of harvested grain due to the presence of deoxynivalenol (DON), a mycotoxin produced by the causal pathogen Fusarium graminearum. DON and other tricothecene mycotoxins pose serious health risks to both humans and livestock, especially swine. Due to these health concerns, barley used for malting, food or feed is routinely assayed for DON levels. Various methods are available for assaying DON levels in grain samples including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). ELISA and GC-MS are very accurate; however, assaying grain samples by these techniques are laborious, expensive and destructive. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using hyperspectral imaging (382–1030 nm) to develop a rapid and non-destructive protocol for assaying DON in barley kernels. Samples of 888 and 116 from various genetic lines were selected for calibration and prediction. Full-wavelength locally weighted partial least squares regression (LWPLSR) achieved high accuracy with the coefficient of determination in prediction (R2P) of 0.728 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 3.802. Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) was used to choose potential feature wavelengths, and these selected variables were further optimized using the iterative selection of successive projections algorithm (ISSPA). The CARS-ISSPA-LWPLSR model developed using 7 feature variables yielded R2P of 0.680 and RMSEP of 4.213 in DON content prediction. Based on the 7 wavelengths selected by CARS-ISSPA, partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) discriminated barley kernels having lower DON (less than1.25 mg/kg) levels from those with higher levels (including 1.25–3 mg/kg, 3–5 mg/kg, and 5–10 mg/kg), with Matthews correlation coefficient in cross-validation (M-RCV) of as high as 0.931. The results demonstrate that hyperspectral imaging have potential for accelerating non-destructive DON assays of barley samples. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Carcass evaluation is a key process to ascertain the value and the quality characteristics of the animal at slaughter. In addition to being the base for monetary transactions between livestock producers and meat processors, in some countries, this evaluation also helps to determine the market allocation of cuts. Recent advances in non-invasive techniques are being tested for their potential to improve classification and grading systems in the meat industry. Scope and approach: In this review, global grading and classification practices for pig, sheep and beef carcasses are discussed along with the latest technological developments in objective carcass measurement. We discuss a number of studies predicting marketable attributes such as yield (lean and saleable meat yield), eating quality attributes (inter- and intra-muscular fat, meat and fat colour) and carcass dimensions (skeletal structure, ribeye area). Technologies based on x-ray, nuclear magnetic resonance, video image analysis, ultrasound, bioelectric impedance and spectroscopy are discussed, along with recent developments and their possible future adoption. Key findings and conclusions: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic induction technologies have been commercialised for the sheep and pig industries, respectively. X-ray technologies and updates in video image analysis could go beyond grading to improve yield and cut dimension predictions. Some technologies could improve process efficiencies through cut sorting and enabling robotic cutting, while also enabling improved value-based payment systems. However, there are challenges associated with their implementation in meat processing plants and further research and development is required in some areas. © 2020},

	abstract = {Background: Many hormones show the effects of protein assimilation and growth promotion, and they are frequently used as veterinary drugs in livestock, which has harmful effects on human health. It is necessary to determine their contamination level in animal-derived food, especially in milk. Objective: In this study, a detailed procedure is described for an automated online solid-phase extraction (SPE)–HPLC method capable of detecting five hormones (i.e., estriol, prednisone acetate, hydrocortisone, diethylstilbestrol, and estrone) in cow milk. Methods: The corresponding milk samples were precipitated by addition of acetonitrile and then purified as well as enriched by a polar-enhanced polymer (PEP) online SPE column. The supernatants were directly injected into the online SPE–HPLC system using methanol–water as the mobile phase mixture. Results: The linearity range of the method was 0.1–25 μg/mL for prednisone acetate, hydrocortisone, and diethylstilbestrol, 0.2–25 μg/mL for estriol, and 0.5–25 μg/mL for estrone, with correlation coefficients (r) ranging from 0.9994 to 0.9996. The recovery rates determined at three concentration levels for the five compounds were in the range of 70.82–112.90%. LODs of estriol, prednisone acetate, hydrocortisone, diethylstilbestrol, and estrone were 0.023, 0.005, 0.006, 0.004, and 0.054 μg/mL, respectively. Conclusions: This automated online SPE–HPLC method was both effective and reliable in the simultaneous measurement of five hormones, and the method was successfully applied to the detection of five hormone species in milk. Highlights: An automated online SPE–HPLC method has been developed for the analysis of five hormones in cow milk. Online SPE proved to be a powerful technique for determining five hormones simultaneously. This method ensured simple sample pretreatment and less operation time. The established method was successfully applied to the analysis of five hormone species in milk. © 2020 AOAC International. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Meat has been an important protein source for human nu-trition for thousands of years and will continue to be. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and Food and Agriculture Organisation's (OECD-FAO)outlook report 2018–2027, the meat consumption increased around 20% in the last ten years, and it is expected to grow another 15% for the next ten years. The harsh working environ-ment in abattoirs and meat factories, such as cold and wet operating rooms and long difficult handling of heavy loads, contributing to the shortage of a skilled labour forces. This, coupled with a considerable increase in the meat consumption, paved the way for novel approaches in the meat industry to ad-dress this challenge, with robotisation and automation of the meat factories being a necessary change. Scope and approach: In this work, we review the current state of robotisa-tion for the meat industry and its adaptability to a new production concept called the meat factory cell (MFC). The reviewed systems are: (a) Frontmatec AiRA Robots for pork slaugh-terlines (b) Mayekawa Hamdas-RX for deboning pork ham; (c) SCOTT Au- tomated Boning Room for lamb slaughterlines; (d) SRDViand (Systemes Robotis'es de D'ecoupe de Viande) Z-cut robotic system to do the separation of the hindquarter and the forequarter; (e) SRDViand ham deboning system; (f) SRDViand ECHORD-DEXDEB, a robotic butcher left hand; (g) SINTEF GRIBBOT, a chicken fillet harvesting robot. Key findings and conclusions: The slaughterhouse processes can be highly automated, with products available at the market, while the meat processing plants are mainly manual; deboning and fine cuts require a higher level of dexterity comparing to primary slaughter cuts, this leads to more researches of intelligent systems. In the other hand, a new way to process the slaughter products can lead to innovation and smarter systems on slaughterhouses, with the benefits to open new opportunities for smaller producers. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The aim of the study was to present a comprehensive characterisation of crayfish meat, which is crucial to assess its potential usefulness in the food industry. To this end, we assessed the yield, basic chemical composition (protein, fat, minerals), nutritional value (amino acid and fatty acid profiles, essential amino acid index (EAAI), chemical score of essential amino acids (CS), hypocholesterolaemic/hypercholesterolaemic ratio (h/H), atherogenicity (AI) and thrombogenicity (TI) indices), as well as culinary value (lab colour, texture, sensory characteristics, structure) of the meat of spiny-cheek crayfish (Faxonius limosus) (n = 226) from Lake Sominko (Poland) harvested in May–September 2017. Crayfish meat, especially that from the abdomen, was shown to have high nutritional parameters. It is lean (0.26% of fat), with a favourable fatty acid profile and a very high quality of fat (PUFA (sum of polyunsaturated fatty acids):SFA (sum of saturated fatty acids), n-6/n-3, h/H, AI, TI) and protein (high CS and EAAI). It is also a better source of Ca, K, Mg, Na, P, and Cu than meat from slaughter animals. Hence, crayfish meat can be an alternative to livestock meat in the human diet. Owing to its culinary value (delicateness, weak game flavour, and odour), it meets the requirements of the most demanding consumers, i.e., children and older people. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and big data are consistently called upon to analyze and comprehend many facets of modern daily life. AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms. Our goal in this review is to assess the progress toward the use of digital twin technology in livestock farming, with the goal of revolutionizing animal husbandry in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {To prevent the outbreak of infectious diseases that inflict huge economic and social losses, domestic livestock farms and related facilities have introduced automatic and semiautomatic disinfectant solution-spraying systems for vehicles. However, the facility standards and specifications vary by manufacturer, and no scientific performance evaluation has been conducted. The puropose of this study is to develop physical and biological evaluation methods. Physical and biological appraisals were conducted using two types of disinfection facilities (tunnel- and U-type) and two types of vehicles (passenger car, truck). Water-sensitive paper was used to evaluate the physical performance values for the disinfection facilities. In addition, to assess their biological performance, carriers containing low-pathogenic avian influenza virus were attached to vehicles, and the viral reduction was measured after the vehicles moved through the facility. The tunnel-type had rates of coverage in the range of 70–90% for the passenger car and 60–90% for the truck. At least 4-log virus reduction after spraying for 1–5 min was shown for both vehicles. For the U-type facility evaluation, the coverage rates were in the range of 60–90% for the passenger car and at least 90% for the truck. More than 4-log viral reduction was estimated within a spraying time of 5 min. To reduce viruses on the surface of vehicles by at least 4 log within a short period, the disinfectant solution should cover at least 71% of the pathogens. In conclusion, we were able to assess the physical and biological performance criteria for disinfection facilities aboard transportation vehicles.

	abstract = {Automatic milking systems (AMS) have aroused worldwide interest recently. The first installation was by the company Lely in a project in the Netherlands (its homeland) in 1992. But nowadays, AMS represents a growing reality due to lobby for labor issues, rising costs, difficulty finding well-trained workers, and/ or difficulty keeping people on farms. This work aimed to present a review of the literature on AMS, beginning with a brief history of the evolution of the technology, showing advantages and limitations of its use, and ultimately giving some suggestions. The understanding of the technical functioning and operational running can help farmers and technicians in decision making on the adoption of the new technology. Besides workforce reduction and labor quality promotion, AMS has potential to improve feed conversion to milk, milk quality (with lower SCC), and cow productivity, as well as providing useful data and parameters for better farm management. Potential limitations include high investment costs, changes in milk composition (solids, free fatty acids), and increased risk of ketosis in cows. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

	abstract = {Livestock producers often resort to either baling or grazing of crop residues due to high hay prices and reduced supply of other forages and silage in the markets. Soil-water-crop management practices can affect residue nutrient qualities for its use as cattle feedstock. A two-year study (2018–2019) was conducted to investigate the effects of irrigation (AI, all row-irrigation; ARI, alternate row irrigation; and RF, rainfed) and planting pattern, PP (SR, single row; and TR, twin-row) on soybean (maturity group IV cv. 31RY45 Dyna-Gro) post-grain harvest residue quality such as crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), net energy for maintenance (NEM), net energy for gain (NEG), net energy for lactation (NEL), total digestible nutrients (TDN), and relative feed value (RFV). Irrigation has a significant effect on CP, ADF, NDF, and TDN while PP affected only NDF. All the above parameters were significantly affected except NEM by the contrasting climate conditions, particularly during July through August coinciding with early crop reproductive stages and maturity. The RFV values ranged from 70.4 to 81.6 and this lower range was attributable to nutrient translocation to seeds and higher lignification during plant senescence towards the grain filling stage of the crop as good quality hay records over 120 RFV. These results indicate that both irrigation and weather during soybean seed development can alter post-grain harvest residue quality parameters, thereby playing critical roles in its RFV. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The assessment of animal welfare on-farm is important to ensure that current welfare standards are followed. The current manual assessment proposed by Welfare Quality® (WQ), although being an essential tool, is only a point-estimate in time, is very time consuming to perform, only evaluates a subset of the animals, and is performed by the subjective human. Automation of the assessment through information technologies (ITs) could provide a continuous objective assessment in real-time on all animals. The aim of the current systematic review was to identify ITs developed for welfare monitoring within the pig production chain, evaluate the ITs developmental stage and evaluate how these ITs can be related to the WQ assessment protocol. The systematic literature search identified 101 publications investigating the development of ITs for welfare monitoring within the pig production chain. The systematic literature analysis revealed that the research field is still young with 97% being published within the last 20 years, and still growing with 63% being published between 2016 and mid-2020. In addition, most focus is still on the development of ITs (sensors) for the extraction and analysis of variables related to pig welfare; this being the first step in the development of a precision livestock farming system for welfare monitoring. The majority of the studies have used sensor technologies detached from the animals such as cameras and micro-phones, and most investigated animal biomarkers over environmental biomarkers with a clear focus on behavioural biomarkers over physiological biomarkers. ITs intended for many different welfare issues have been studied, although a high number of publications did not specify a welfare issue and instead studied a general biomarker such as activity, feeding behaviour and drinking behaviour. The ‘good feeding’ principle of the WQ assessment protocol was the best represented with ITs for real-time on-farm welfare assessment, while for the other principles only few of the included WQ measures are so far covered. No ITs have yet been developed for the ‘Comfort around resting’ and the ‘Good human-animal relationship’ criteria. Thus, the potential to develop ITs for welfare assessment within the pig production is high and much work is still needed to end up with a remote solution for welfare assessment on-farm and in real-time. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Precision livestock farming has become an inevitable trend for agricultural industry in the world. In that field, precision feeding is widely acknowledged because of its potential to reduce feed costs, environmental footprint and to improve animal health and welfare. Precision feeding involves modern multidisciplinary technologies such as information technology, mechanics, electronics, automation, etc. Such a system consists of automatic troughs linked to a computer system to exploit data collected from the individual animals (e.g. body weight, feed intake and feeding behaviour), and/or from ambient sensors. Data is processed and analysed based on mathematical models to make predictions, warnings for farmers or to formulate diets that fit requirements of each individual animal at each production period. However, implementing such a system often requires high investment, which may go beyond the capabilities of smallholders and small/medium laboratories. Furthermore, the risk of implementing by design but not conforming to reality is very high. To avoid this problem, we introduce an agent-based modelling approach to simulate precision feeding systems for swine. Two simulation experiments were conducted to provide predictions about the growth of individual pigs and the usefulness of precision feeding systems over classic feeding models.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A year into the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper reflects on the changes that occurred in agrifood supply chains in Canada and the United States. The sudden shift in food consumption patterns from food service to food retail required realignment of food supply chains. For the most part, food supply chains have performed remarkably well during the pandemic. Cross-border food supply chains have continued to function effectively. The most significant disruptions emerged from workforce outbreaks of COVID-19 in the meat processing sector and in fruit and vegetable production. The paper discusses supply chain resilience and argues that agrifood supply chains are characterized by several important differences that need to be taken into consideration when evaluating resilience. Economies of scale and scope offer economic efficiency advantages in normal times, while investments in adaptability and flexibility can enhance resilience for abnormal times. Potential long-run changes within supply chains include increased automation and digitalization in food supply chains, while investments in infrastructure for online delivery services have permanently altered the food retailing landscape. © 2021 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society},

The authors analyse the potential of biogas production from livestock and poultry waste in the agro-industrial complexes of Kazakhstan. During the analysis, it was revealed that the largest volumes of organic waste are produced by cattle breeding, and the smallest – by poultry farming. The article presents an assessment method based on the construction of a two-factor correlation-regression model, in which the effective (endogenous) factor feature is the total production of biogas and the total biomass is selected as an independent (exogenous) factor feature. The results of the calculations showed that the models reflecting the dependence of the total biogas production on the total biomass for cattle, sheep and goats, as well as poultry, correspond to the real flow of processes in the economy and logic. © 2021, Econjournals.

Monitoring pigs’ behavioral activities can allow us to detect pathological changes in pigs earlier and identify the factors threatening the health of pigs in advance. Pigs tend to be farmed on a large scale, and manual observation by keepers is time consuming and laborious. Therefore, the use of computers to monitor the growth processes of pigs in real time, and to recognize the duration and frequency of pigs’ pos-tural changes over time, can prevent outbreaks of porcine diseases. The contributions of this article are as follows: (1) The first human-annotated pig-posture-identification dataset in the world was established, including 800 pictures of each of the four pig postures: standing, lying on the stomach, lying on the side, and exploring. (2) When using a deep separable convolutional network to classify pig postures, the accuracy was 92.45%. The results show that the method proposed in this paper achieves adequate pig-posture recognition in a piggery environment and may be suitable for livestock farm applications. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In recent years, the technical level of agricultural production has increased significantly and new means of mechanization and automation of crop and livestock production are being successfully introduced. At the same time, further progress in this direction is impossible without systematically organized work aimed at the development and implementation of modern automatic control systems for various processes. Works in this area are based primarily on a detailed study of properties of various objects of agricultural production, as mathematical modeling of real processes and devices is the basis for analysis and synthesis of effective automatic control systems. Recently, there has been a transition from the modeling of individual devices to the modeling of complex technological schemes, which is largely due to a significant increase in complexity and dimension of the problems to be solved. Therefore, this approach allows setting and solving optimal control problems not only for separate devices but for entire technological complexes, which in turn provides significant economic effect and application in solving many engineering problems. © 2020 DAV College.

	abstract = {Knowledge of the body composition of growing pigs is of interest to breeding companies and producers, as it can be used to optimize production. As an emerging noninvasive technology computed tomography (CT) has been extensively applied in animal production studies. Recently, deep learning has generated new insights in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we describe a noninvasive method to automatically divide and quantify the composition of live pigs based on CT imaging and the application of deep neural network. The method consists of torso segmentation, visceral tissue removal, and identification and quantification of bone, lean meat, and fat using CT scans. The challenge addressed by this method is to identify the internal organs with complex structures and variable densities, the heart, lung, liver, stomach, spleen, kidney, colon, cecum, esophagus, jejunum, uterine horn, bladder, ureter, and rectum. We developed a bidirectional convolutional residual (BCR) framework to automatically and precisely segment the internal organs in a set of CT scans, and all internal organs share one label to remove these organs at once. To facilitate comparison with previous models, we tested BCR framework and found that it outperforms the classical approaches U-Net, residual U-Net (Res-U-Net) and dense U-Net (Dense-U-Net). We experimented on 40 pigs and compared our method with manual dissection. The results correlated well, and demonstrate that our method can accurately estimate the body composition proportion of fat, lean meat and bone—of live pigs, so the method will be valuable for livestock production. © 2021},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Sheep production systems need to become more carbon efficient to meet growing public demands on climate change. Some of the ways postulated to achieve this is to implement new technologies and management strategies such as precision livestock farming (PLF), increased use of high genetic merit animals with estimated breeding values through artificial insemination (AI) where practical, and the use of prolific breeds. However, the carbon footprint impact of these strategies has not to-date been quantified. Additionally, international experience indicates that uptake of such strategies is low due, in part, to the perception of increased workload especially during busy periods of the sheep year. OBJECTIVES: This trans-European study investigates the impact of differing sheep management strategies on farm labour input, carbon footprint as well as the on-farm profitability, to address these concerns. METHODS: Four management strategies were considered i) use of technology (PLF), ii) use of performance recording for higher genetic merit, iii) use of AI for higher genetic merit and iv) and use of prolific breeds, in 14 case study flocks located in areas typical of Northern European grassland sheep production systems across Scotland, France, Ireland and Norway. For each management strategy, paired case study flocks were identified. Labour was assessed at key handling events using video recording, farmers' diaries, and questionnaires, which were later quantified and classed into key tasks to create normalised labour profiles for each case study flock. The carbon footprint was quantified using a carbon calculator tool (www.agrecalc.com). Financial net margins were calculated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results highlighted that introducing PLF technology on extensive farms reduced labour by 20% and increased economic margins by £9/ewe but with a concurrent increase in carbon emissions (kg CO2e/ kg of meat produced). Using performance recording on sheep farms for achieving higher genetic merit increased economic margins by £6/ewe, and reduced carbon emissions (kg CO2e) per kg of meat produced but resulted in 10% extra labour. AI on farms increased economic margins by £50/ewe, did not incur extra labour and increased carbon efficiency in terms of kg CO2e/kg meat produced. Finally, high prolific breeds did not significantly increase labour input at key handling events and resulted by higher economic margins (+£3/ewe), without a change in terms of kg CO2e/kg meat produced. SIGNIFICANCE: These novel case studies clearly illustrate it is possible to increase carbon and labour efficiency by adopting technology, changing breeding management or ewe breed on sheep farms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are having a great impact on all aspects of society. However, due to the technical competencies and mathematical understanding required for implementing solutions leveraging these technologies, access to the communities working on these technologies is limited to those having these skills. This limits the ability of domain experts to directly transfer their knowledge and contribute to the development of AI and ML systems. To address this problem, we propose the Human Education AI Teaming (HEAT) framework, in which we draw on human education to design an innovative education system to enable collaboration between humans and AI cognitive agents. The main aim of HEAT is to promote the social integration of AI by allowing domain experts to focus more on communicating a body of knowledge to the machine, and less on the computational, data, and engineering concepts associated with how the machine learns. We follow an educational theory-driven approach to derive the content knowledge and competencies required by each agent. We conclude the paper with a demonstration case study explaining how the complex autonomous guidance of a flock of sheep could leverage HEAT to make the technology accessible by empowering non-AI specialists, livestock farmers in our example.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The present study reports the development of a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) model for predicting the thermal performance of evaporative cooling systems, which are widely used for thermal comfort in different applications. The existing, conventional methods for the analysis of evaporation‐assisted cooling systems rely on experimental, mathematical, and empirical approaches in order to determine their thermal performance, which limits their applications in diverse and ambient spatiotemporal conditions. The objective of this research was to predict the thermal performance of three evaporation‐assisted air‐conditioning systems—direct, indirect, and Maisotsenko evaporative cooling systems—by using an AI approach. For this purpose, a deep learning algorithm was developed and lumped hyperparameters were initially chosen. A correlation analysis was performed prior to the development of the AI model in order to identify the input features that could be the most influential for the prediction efficiency. The deep learning algorithm was then optimized to increase the learning rate and predictive accuracy with respect to experimental data by tuning the hyperparameters, such as by manipulating the activation functions, the number of hidden layers, and the neurons in each layer by incorporating optimizers, including Adam and RMsprop. The results confirmed the applicability of the method with an overall value of R2 = 0.987 between the input data and ground‐truth data, showing that the most competent model could predict the designated output features (Tdboutdbout, wout, and Eairout). The suggested method is straightforward and was found to be practical in the evaluation of the thermal performance of deployed air conditioning systems under different conditions. The results supported the hypothesis that the proposed deep learning AI algorithm has the potential to explore the feasibility of the three evaporative cooling systems in dynamic ambient conditions for various agricultural and livestock applications. © 2021 by the authors.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the future which is influencing everyone’s lives by acting intelligently. Research organizations and institutions of higher learning are constantly working to create solutions and products based on the IoT. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that promises innovative solutions for modern agriculture. New Smart Farming innovations using IoT are slowly but firmly changing the nature of traditional farming methods, not only by making them more efficient but also by reducing farmers’ costs. The goal is to spread technology that can send alerts to farmers via various platforms. Farmers will benefit from this product as it will provide them with real-time data from their farms (UV index, temperature, soil moisture, humidity, and so on), allowing them to take the necessary steps to increase crop yields while conserving resources (water, fertilizer). The chapter begins with a history of agriculture, followed by advances in agricultural technology, smart farming using IoT. The chapter also highlights the benefits and the limitations of IoT in agriculture.

	abstract = {Automated systems based on wearable sensors for livestock monitoring are becoming increasingly popular. Specifically, wireless in-body sensors could yield relevant data, such as ruminal temperature. The collection of such data requires an accurate characterization of the in-to-out body wireless channel between the in-body sensor and the gateway. The aim of this study is to experimentally characterize the in-to-out-body propagation loss for cows and horses at 433, 868, and 1400 MHz. Measurements were conducted in vivo on five different fistulated cows and five horse cadavers using specialized robust in-body capsule antennas inside the animals' abdomen. Next, the in-body antenna gain was deembedded from the wireless channel, and the in-to-out body propagation loss was obtained as the difference between measured unobstructed line-of-sight path losses and in-to-out-body path losses. The measurements showed a body propagation loss of (mean ± standard deviation) 30.8 ± 4.1 dB, 44.5 ± 4.8 dB, and 54.2 ± 4.7 dB for cows at 433, 868, and 1400 MHz, respectively. For horses, the body propagation losses were 23.2 ± 3.8 dB, 31.0 ± 4.7 dB, and 44.4 ± 3.2 dB at 433, 868, and 1400 MHz, respectively. These results are important to determine the wireless range of WBANs to optimize the network topology and estimate the associated network cost for large-scale monitoring systems. © 2021 IEEE.

	abstract = {The maternal environment modulates immune responses to facilitate embryo development and ensure pregnancy. Unraveling this modulation could improve the livestock breeding systems. Here it is hypothesized that the exposure of the female rabbit reproductive tract to semen, as well as to early embryos, modulates inflammation and angiogenesis among different tissue segments. qPCR analysis of the gene expression changes of the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL10) and transforming growth factor beta family (TGFβ1–3) and the angiogenesis mediator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) were examined in response to mating or insemination with sperm-free seminal plasma (SP). Reproductive tract segment (cervix to infundibulum) samples were obtained in Experiment 1, 20 h after gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation (control), natural mating (NM) or vaginal infusion with sperm-free SP (SP-AI). Additionally, segmented samples were also obtained at 10, 24, 36, 68 or 72 h after GnRH-stimulation and natural mating (Experiment 2). The results of gene expression, analyzed by quantitative PCR, showed that NM effects were mainly localized in the uterine tissues, depicting clear temporal variation, while SP-AI effects were restricted to the oviduct. Changes in anti-inflammatory and angiogenesis mediators indicate an early response in the uterus and a late modulation in the oviduct either induced by semen or preimplantation embryos. This knowledge could be used in the implementation of physiological strategies in breeding systems to face the new challenges on rabbit productivity and sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Presently, there is an increased demand for livestock products all over the world which has led to more devotion on improving livestock population. Although goats have been bred for a long time in Korea, but there is not much research conducted on traditional Korean black goat (Capra hircus coreanae) compared to other livestock populations. Mutton consumption has been dramatically changing from medicinal use to edible meat and this trend directs the black goat populations declining and also mutton import quantities are increasing consistently. The present study introduced a new estrus synchronizing technique with subsequent artificial insemination (AI) for Korean black goats to enable crossbreeding with non-native breeds for the small or subsistent farmers. Our data highlighted that, the percentage of motile sperm from the electro-ejaculated samples declined significantly after freezing and melting. In addition, the sperm motility significantly declined with regard to sperm incubation period (0, 5, 60, and 120 min at 37℃) and was negatively correlated (64.2 ± 7.9%, 63.3 ± 5.8%, 49.9 ± 6.3%, and 35.9 ± 7.6%, respectively) in frozen-thawed sperm samples. Moreover, the E2 levels were unchanged even 24 h after controlled internal drug releas (CIDR) withdrawal. But, 48 h and 72 h after CIDR removal, E2 levels increased significantly. These data helps us to consider the two time points for AI; CIDR removal after 24 h, at which E2 decreases, and after 48 h, as the time at which progesterone increases. Additionally, the AI after 48 h of CIDR removal group exhibited significantly higher pregnancy and parturition rates (42.9%) compared to AI after 24 h after CIDR removal 28.6% group. In conclusion, these studies will propose an optimal estrus synchronisation process with subsequent timing of AI and also will promote the Korean black goat breeding industry.

	abstract = {To solve the worldwide problems in the traditional poultry meat cutting process, including high labor costs, high safety risks, and other global problems, a robot autonomous cutting production line system was designed by integrating the key technologies such as accurate perception, rapid cutting, and autonomous deboning. To meet the requirements of efficient automatic classification and packaging for chicken breasts and wings (including wing tip, middle joint, and root) produced in the autonomous cutting process, a new recognition method combining image processing, convolutional neural network (CNN) classification, and the hardware/software collaborative framework was proposed, aiming to achieve the function integration and real-time requirements of image acquisition, processing, and detection. Firstly, the meat area was extracted to distinguish chicken breast and wing tip; secondly, the wing middle and root were classified based on CNN technology; finally, the recognition speed via software/hardware cooperation was estimated by parameter and computational efficiency analysis in the recognition algorithm. With the meat identification system platform built, the motion blur of the conveyor belt at full speed was analyzed, and the data set was expanded by data enhancement. In order to reduce the amount of computation, only the image data of R channel was used as the input of neural network. The results show that the recognition accuracy of chicken breast and wing tip can reach 100%, and that of wing middle and root can reach 98.7%, with recognition speed of 0.047 seconds, which could meet the research and development needs of efficient sorting of 10,000 poultries per hour for future work. © 2021, Editorial of Board of Journal of Graphics.

	abstract = {Background and Aim: Healthy goat meat is an essential aspect in increasing consumer acceptance for this livestock product. The research aimed to examine the effect of goat meat containing low cholesterol and rich omega-6 fatty acid on the performance and blood lipid status of white rats (Rattus norvegicus). Materials and Methods: Thirty 2-month-old male white rats (R. norvegicus) weighing 195-230 g were randomly divided into three groups, with each group consisting of 10 rats. Group I was treated with a control feed (T0; BR I concentrate). Group II (T1) was treated with a mixed feed containing 50% control feed and 50% goat meat. Group III (T2) was treated with a mixed feed comprising 50% control feed and 50% goat meat with low cholesterol and rich omega-6 fatty acids. Each treatment was given ad libitum for 30 days. The variables measured were dry matter and organic matter consumption, daily body weight gain, feed conversion, triglyceride levels, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and atherogenic index (AI). The data were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance in a completely randomized design. Results: The total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels at T0, T1, and T2 were as follows: 99.97, 35.97, and 50.43 mg/dL (total cholesterol); 108.35, 33.92, and 58.17 mg/dL (HDL cholesterol); and 101.43, 38.09, and 48.65 mg/dL (LDL cholesterol). The highest HDL and the lowest LDL cholesterol levels (p<0.05) were observed in the T2 treatment group, which had the lowest AI (1.69 vs. 1.77 and 2.19). Conclusion: The consumption of goat with low cholesterol and rich omega-6 fatty acids reduces the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, raises the HDL cholesterol levels, and decreases the AI.

	abstract = {Remote monitoring, modern data collection through sensors, rapid data transfer, and vast data storage through the Internet of Things (IoT) have advanced precision livestock farming (PLF) in the last 20 yr. PLF is relevant to many fields of livestock production, including aerial-and satellite-based measurement of pasture's forage quantity and quality; body weight and composition and physiological assessments; on-Animal devices to monitor location, activity, and behaviors in grazing and foraging environments; early detection of lameness and other diseases; milk yield and composition; reproductive measurements and calving diseases; and feed intake and greenhouse gas emissions, to name just a few. There are many possibilities to improve animal production through PLF, but the combination of PLF and computer modeling is necessary to facilitate on-farm applicability. Concept-or knowledge-driven (mechanistic) models are established on scientific knowledge, and they are based on the conceptualization of hypotheses about variable interrelationships. Artificial intelligence (AI), on the other hand, is a data-driven approach that can manipulate and represent the big data accumulated by sensors and IoT. Still, it cannot explicitly explain the underlying assumptions of the intrinsic relationships in the data core because it lacks the wisdom that confers understanding and principles. The lack of wisdom in AI is because everything revolves around numbers. The associations among the numbers are obtained through the "automatized"learning process of mathematical correlations and covariances, not through "human causation"and abstract conceptualization of physiological or production principles. AI starts with comparative analogies to establish concepts and provides memory for future comparisons. Then, the learning process evolves from seeking wisdom through the systematic use of reasoning. AI is a relatively novel concept in many science fields. It may well be "the missing link"to expedite the transition of the traditional maximizing output mentality to a more mindful purpose of optimizing production efficiency while alleviating resource allocation for production. The integration between concept-and data-driven modeling through parallel hybridization of mechanistic and AI models will yield a hybrid intelligent mechanistic model that, along with data collection through PLF, is paramount to transcend the current status of livestock production in achieving sustainability.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

Aerial surveys are a critical tool, but new methods for these surveys generate massive image archives. The act of scanning these images is time-consuming and difficult, leading to significant delays in converting data into action. To address this Development Seed and the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI), developed an AI-assisted methodology, specifically, Tensorflow based image classification and object detection methods that significantly increase the speed of spotting and counting wildlife, human activities, and livestock after aerial surveys.

Once the training data quality and model performance of AI-assisted workflow mature and stabilize, we foresee the hours spent on getting accurate human-wildlife proximity maps would only take 19% of current human manual workflow, and potentially reduce the cost of identifying and counting objects over 81,000 aerial images from $20,000 to less than $5,000. © 2021 IEEE},

The organisation under study is encountering a glitch of production wastage, which further leads to failure to reach daily production targets. The research question is: What is the importance of automation in the meat production processes? To address the question, the qualitative research approach was adopted in this study, in which observations are utilized for data collection. The observed data was presented in a case study form to allow in-depth analysis and enable ease of interpretation and understanding. The researcher found several key outcomes which include lack of display of Standard operating procedures, inadequate training, and poor management. Hence, it was recommended that display of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) next to all machines in use should be visible, employees should be provided with proper training and lastly, the managers should also receive the specific training that will enable them to make a well-informed decision, properly treat employees and change their poor behavioural actions, and lastly the utilization of fixed automation.

	abstract = {Freshwater lakes are dynamic ecosystems and provide multiple ecosystem services to humans. Sudden changes in lake environmental conditions such as cyanobacterial blooms can negatively impact lake usage. Automated high-frequency monitoring (AHFM) systems allow the detection of short-lived extreme and unpredictable events and enable lake managers to take mitigation actions earlier than if basing decisions on conventional monitoring programmes. In this study a cost-benefit approach was used to compare the costs of implementing and running an AHFM system with its potential benefits for three case study lakes. It was shown that AHFM can help avoid human health impacts, lost recreation opportunities, and revenue losses for livestock, aquaculture and agriculture as well as reputational damages for drinking water treatment. Our results showed that the largest benefits of AHFM can be expected in prevention of human health impacts and reputational damages. The potential benefits of AHFM, however, do not always outweigh installation and operation costs. While for Lake Kinneret (Israel) over a 10-year period, the depreciated total benefits are higher than the depreciated total costs, this is not the case for Lough Gara (Ireland). For Lake Mälaren in Sweden it would depend on the configuration of the AHFM system, as well as on how the benefits are calculated. In general, the higher the frequency and severity of changes in lake environmental conditions associated with detrimental consequences for humans and the higher the number of lake users, the more likely it is that the application of an AHFM system is financially viable. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The paper focuses on the development of the concept of technological import substitution of livestock, which should ensure the sustainable development of the industry through the modernization of the material and technical base and intensification of production. The scientific hypothesis of the study is based on the statement about the need for accelerated development of domestic agricultural engineering to meet the growing needs of the industry in modern technology. An analysis of the state of technological development and the level of import dependence of the industry showed that further intensification of production and increasing the competitiveness of livestock products are impossible without comprehensive mechanization and automation of technological processes. The role of livestock breeding as a production basis and a key factor in the implementation of the concept of technological modernization of the industry are determined. It has been established that increasing the import of breeding resources and the low level of selection and breeding work leads to an increase in technological import dependence and a decrease in the stability of livestock farming under the influence of adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic factors. The effectiveness of implementing technological import substitution will largely depend on the intensification of scientific research, development work on the development of new machinery and equipment for livestock, the use of modern methods in breeding and biotechnology. The scientific and methodological base of the study formed the basis for “Development of a system of machines for mechanization and automation of processes and the use of digital technologies for keeping and feeding animals for the period until 2030.”. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Animal husbandry plays an important role in India’s economy. It is an integral component of Indian agriculture supporting livelihood of more than two-thirds of the rural populations through milk production, employment for ~ 8.8% population, improving the nutritional status and income. It is also considered to be a profitable enterprise which gives income throughout the year. It requires less capital, management and production expenses as compared to agriculture. Demand for milk in the country is increasing day by day owing to increase in human population and individual income. Current demand of milk is ≤8%, which will increase further while milk production is growing at 6.6%. India has emerged as leading milk producer country in the world, however productivity of dairy animals is very low. Low genetic potential and poor nutrition are considered to be the major factors responsible for lower productivity of Indian cattle and buffaloes. To improve their genetic potential a major focus should be to breed these animals using semen from high genetic merit bulls through artificial insemination (AI). This is a well proven technology and accepted across the world for faster multiplication of superior germplasm. The major issue in harnessing the optimum success of AI technology in our country is its quite low coverage as compared to the developed nations. To implement AI in a larger geographical area and bigger livestock population, there is a requirement of developing basic infrastructure, quality frozen semen from elite bulls, skilled manpower, awareness among the farmers to breed their dairy animals through AI using high genetic merit bull semen and AI services at the farmers’ door steps to achieve the goal of improving the productivity of dairy animals. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Robotic systems are appearing in more and more professional service applications, while mechanic and control system components are evolving fast themselves, the legislation and standards regarding these topics are lagging behind. In connection with the RoBUTCHER project - which is a pioneer research effort employing industrial robots for completely automated slaughtering - it was revealed that there are no particular standards regulating directly robotics applied to the agri-food application domain. More specifically, the meat industry and the red meat sector within has only seen hygienic standards regarding machinery, not considering human-robot collaboration or safe autonomous robot operation in the abattoirs. The purpose of this paper is to provide a general overview of the relevant standards (and similar guiding documents) that could be used as pathfinders during the development of inherently safe robotic systems. Exploring the standard and legislation landscape should offer some instrumental help regarding the foreseen certification process of meat processing robots and robot cells in the near future. © 2021 IEEE.},

The study notes that the introduction of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotics can be widely applied in the agricultural sector. It is noted that the agricultural has a number of specific features: a variety of biological objects that are affected; various and complex technological processes, distribution of controlled parameters over a large area; high risks of the external environment. In this regard, the use of technologies for working with large data arrays is especially important here. The smart Agriculture concept will allow monitoring the growth of crops, a decision-making system for irrigation and the choice of fertilizers. The main goals of introducing digital technologies into agricultural production are to increase labor productivity, increase the quantity and quality of products. The introduction of digital technologies will make it possible to manage the quality of agricultural products through the introduction of modern breeding and genetic developments, provide an individual approach to the maintenance and feeding of livestock and poultry. The use of digital technologies has a positive environmental effect and will reduce the harmful impact on the environment. Updating the technological base of agricultural production through the use of digital technologies will allow controlling costs and increasing the economic efficiency. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.},

For any AI attempt converting into successful fertilization leading to conception, it is important to ensure semen used is of good quality, for which minimum pre and post thaw parameters have been set, before it is set for freezing. Starting with gross physical examination, data generation on microscopic and biochemical parameters at pre and post thaw stages of frozen semen are in practice. Similar to the selection of animals for the improvement of production traits, it is also important to emphasize the inclusion of genetic and nongenetic basis, while selecting bulls for semen quality. To capture the changes happening at molecular levels, leading to variations in individual bull, discovery and the use of biomarkers is an important approach. Newer technologies like next-generation sequencing, leading to generation of whole genome sequence data for genomic selection, transcriptome analysis, whole genome methylation and proteome analysis are helping in identification and use of these biomarkers for faster genetic gain and improvement of productivity including reproduction traits. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {A poultry farm monitoring system along with a livestock monitoring system is a principal system for investigating the status of bird health by collecting biological traits such as their uttered sounds. This theme combines the Internet of Things (IoT) with nonintrusive and reliable wearable sensing technology. In recent developments, machine learning (ML) or artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been well applied and recognized as an effective tool for a range of complicated scenario analyses in real time, including healthcare sector applications. This will help to alleviate problems typically suffered and faced by medical researchers in these fields by saving time for practitioners by providing unbiased results. In this chapter we discuss the utilization of analytics learning and neural network usage toward clinical concerns in health care using the IoT. ANN is a prime research domain with recent deployment of computational sophistication in hardware and software in several application domains with highly complicated computing scenarios. The healthcare sector is one area which is capable of automation to save time and that is subjective by nature. Therefore, ML- and ANN-based simulations generate unbiased outcomes. This chapter describes an IoT-structured wearable sensing platform with the inclusion of an audio feature and temperature of the livestock. In particular, the secure audio-wellbeing features are incorporated into the platform to spontaneously examine and conclude using voice information from the livestock for recognition of diseased birds. One month of long-term recognition experimentation analysis was performed where the recognition accuracy of the onset of disease bird was about 91% using a spiking neural network (SNN).The recognition accuracy of SNN in this regard is better than the performance of an ANN. A sequence of steps was taken in connection with a specific event that occurred and involved in examining the interrelationship across the central monitoring unit and the local monitoring unit using the IoT by utilizing the bird voice features, bird temperature, and room temperature and humidity. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The success of inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines has enhanced livestock productivity, promoted food security, and attenuated the morbidity and mortality of several human, animal, and zoonotic diseases. However, these traditional vaccine technologies are not without fault. The efficacy of inactivated vaccines can be suboptimal with particular pathogens and safety concerns arise with live-attenuated vaccines. Additionally, the rate of emerging infectious diseases continues to increase and with that the need to quickly deploy new vaccines. Unfortunately, first generation vaccines are not conducive to such urgencies. Within the last three decades, veterinary medicine has spearheaded the advancement in novel vaccine development to circumvent several of the flaws associated with classical vaccines. These third generation vaccines, including DNA, RNA and recombinant viral-vector vaccines, induce both humoral and cellular immune response, are economically manufactured, safe to use, and can be utilized to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals.

	abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate the threshold effects of infectious diseases on livestock prices. Daily retail prices of pork and chicken were used as structured data; news and SNS mentions of African Swine Fever (ASF) and Avian Influenza (AI) were used as unstructured data. Models were tested for the threshold effects of disease-related news and SNS frequencies, specifically those related to ASF and AI, on the retail prices of pork and chicken, respectively. The effects were found to exist, and the values of ASF-related news on pork prices were estimated to be −9 and 8, indicating that the threshold autoregressive (TAR) model can be divided into three regimes. The coefficients of the ASF-related SNS frequencies on pork prices were 1.1666, 0.2663 and −0.1035 for regimes 1, 2 and 3, respectively, suggesting that pork prices increased by 1.1666 Korean won in regime 1 when ASF-related SNS frequencies increased. To promote pork consumption by SNS posts, the required SNS frequencies were estimated to have impacts as great as one standard deviation in the pork price. These values were 247.057, 1309.158 and 2817.266 for regimes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The impact response periods for pork prices were estimated to last 48, 6, and 8 days for regimes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. When the prediction accuracies of the TAR and autoregressive (AR) models with regard to pork prices were compared for the root mean square error, the prediction accuracy of the TAR model was found to be slightly better than that of the AR. When the threshold effect of AI-related news on chicken prices was tested, a linear relationship appeared without a threshold effect. These findings suggest that when infectious diseases such as ASF occur for the first time, the impact on livestock prices is significant, as indicated by the threshold effect and the long impact response period. Our findings also suggest that the impact on livestock prices is not remarkable when infectious diseases occur multiple times, as in the case of AI. To date, this study is the first to suggest the use of SNS to promote meat consumption. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Automated livestock monitoring is a promising solution for vast and isolated farmlands or cattle stations. The advancement in sensor technology and the rise of unmanned systems have paved the way for the automated systems. In this work, we propose an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) based livestock detection-counting system for fusion images using restricted supervised learning technique. For image fusion, we propose Dual-scale image Decomposition based Fusion technique (DDF) that fuses visible and thermal images. To reduce the difficulty of ground truth annotation, we introduce Seed Labels focused Object Detector (SLOD) that carefully propagates the annotation to all the object instances in the training images. Further, we propose a novel Restricted Supervised Learning (RSL) technique that produces competitive results with minimal training data. Experimental results show that the proposed RSL is more efficient and accurate when compared to other learning techniques (fully and weakly supervised). On the test data, with only five training images and five seed labels, the restricted supervised learning has improved the average precision from 4.05% (using fully supervised learning) to 80.58% (using restricted supervised learning). With 50 seed labels, the average precision is further boosted to 91.56%. The proposed model is extensively tested on benchmark animal datasets and has achieved an average accuracy of 98.3%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In the near future, the year 2050, agricultural production should expand to fulfill the needs of approximately 9.7 billion inhabitants. Such an objective should be harmonized with social, economic, and environmental sustainability aspects to maintain safe food production and food security worldwide. For more than a year, the COVID-19 pandemic has raised and is still strongly disrupting the agro-livestock production sector, similar to several other economic sectors. In this sector, the relationships between suppliers, producers, and consumers should always continue to maintain the activity of the production chain, which are impaired by social distancing decisions taken following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, a global cross-sectional survey (translated into four languages: Arabic, English, French, and Spanish) was shared with people belonging to the agricultural sector to identify: (1) the role of the agricultural information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agro-livestock farming systems sustainability during the period of COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the need for such technologies in the agricultural sector, and (3) the factors that affect the use of such technologies. The results showed that the most frequently used agricultural ICTs were social media (Facebook and/or WhatsApp; 27.3%) and online platforms and Internet services (26.3%), whereas robotic vehicles and/or drones (6.6%) were less frequently used. During the emergence of the pandemic, the major reasons impacting agro-livestock farming systems’ sustainability were social distancing (30.0%), shortage of labor (17.7%), maintaining precision farm management (14.8%), product marketing (14.2%), access production inputs (7.2%), and others (16.1%). Applying agricultural ICTs solved many obstacles related to the production process, such as maintaining precision farm management (25.6%), product marketing (23.6%), and access production inputs (16.1%). The subgroup analyses of the results considering the degree of country advancement, size of agribusinesses, and role/position of respondents in the farm highlighted the importance of supporting the use, availability, and awareness of agricultural ICTs at least for some groups of people such as those belong to developing countries, laborers, and small-scale agri-business holders. This cross-sectional study highlights the urgent need to turn to and to expand the use of new agricultural ICTs to meet the growing demand for food production in the world and to ensure the resilience and sustainability of farming systems, specifically under unexpected and extreme conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

This study presents a conceptual level techno-economic analysis of four concepts where food is produced by microorganisms based on wheat straw. Three single-cell proteins and one recombinant protein process were conceptualized. The process included steam explosion pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, and downstream processing. The enzymatic hydrolysis was optimized to minimize the production costs. The minimum protein selling price was determined by net present value using the discounted cash-flow method, which was compared to respective animal and plant proteins. The minimum protein selling prices were 5160–9007 €/ton proposing the processes to be in the feasible range, but the processes still require further development. The sensitivity of the parameters was estimated by sensitivity analysis, which revealed the most critical components in the production to be capacity, investment, interest, and enzyme and raw material costs. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Paratuberculosis is an enteric disease caused by Mycobacterium avium sp. paratuberculosis (MAP) that affects mainly ruminant producing losses to the livestock industry. Many molecular epidemiological methods have been used to discriminate MAP isolates. Method: The aim of this study was to describe the genetic diversity of the Argentinean MAP isolates using a combination of two molecular systems, the mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) ('automated and 'non-automated') and the multi-locus short-sequence repeat (MLSSR) system. Results: Thirty-two isolates were identified as MAP of C type by IS900 polymerase chain reaction (PCA) and IS1311 PCA-restriction enzyme analysis. The main patterns found by both MIRU-VNTR systems were INMV1 (54.5%), INMV2 (24.2%) and INMV11 (9.1%). The INMV5, INMV8 and INMV16 were represented with one isolate each (3.0%). Only 4 MIRU-VNTR loci were polymorphic. Conclusion: Those isolates sharing the same INMV patterns were analyzed by MLSSR, being locus 2 the most polymorphic one showing isolates with 9, 10, 11, and more than 11 'G' repeats. Besides, the global discriminatory power among isolates could be increased using both techniques. Based on these results, a short version of the 'automated' MIRU-VNTR could be used as a screening tool to group isolates genetically related and subsequently perform the SSR using locus 2 on those isolates sharing the same INMV pattern. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

	abstract = {Numerous bibliographic reviews related to the use of AI for the behavioral detection of farm animals exist, but they only focus on a particular type of animal. We believe that some techniques were used for some animals that could also be used for other types of animals. The application and comparison of these techniques between animal species are rarely done. In this paper, we propose a review of machine learning approaches used for the detection of farm animals' behaviors such as lameness, grazing, rumination, and so on. The originality of this paper is matched classification in the midst of sensors and algorithms used for each animal category. First, we highlight the most implemented approaches for different categories of animals (cows, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and chickens) to inspire researchers interested to conduct investigation and employ the methods we have evaluated and the results we have obtained in this study.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an evolving trend in the field of computer applications where various hardware and software are connected together to address a specific problem. With the help of the IoT, the world has become smart and enabled itself to connect various objects (e.g., cars, computers, mobile phones, and smart appliances) with distinctive Internet protocol addresses, which allows them to interact with one another, thus accomplishing various procedures. Applications of the IoT include but are not restricted to smart cities, healthcare, industry, and robotics. Amongst a huge list of applications furnished by the IoT, agricultural IoT is the theme of this chapter. The IoT in agriculture transforms entities such as crops, soils, and livestock in a smart way by utilizing underlying technologies such as embedded systems, pervasive computing, sensor networks, ubiquitous computing, ad hoc networks, various wireless communication technologies, Internet protocols and other advanced technologies. The research here focuses on the most important agriculture entity – soil. It is the soil that determines the yield of a crop. The more fertile the soil, more qualitative is the yield. The main idea behind the research is to identify the soil most suitable for agriculture. Using a spatio-temporal model, the soil samples collected from various parts of the country are classified into agricultural soil and non-agricultural soil. This classification is done by the aid of features such as the pH of the soil, and its humidity, moisture, and temperature collected from IoT sensors. The chapter begins with an introduction to the usage of IoT technology in different areas of agriculture followed by an account of the proposed state-of-the-art model, and its results, analysis, and a conclusion. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Vikram Bali, Vishal Bhatnagar, Deepti Aggarwal, Shivani Bali, and Mario José Diván; individual chapters, the contributors.},

Nevertheless, this is not the case for indoor livestock and farming environments due to several challenges and constraints. These indoor environments are limited in physical space and there is the localization problem, due to GPS unavailability. Therefore, this work aims to give a step toward the usage of drones for indoor farming and livestock management. To investigate on the drone positioning in these workspaces, two visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM)—LSD-SLAM and ORB-SLAM—algorithms were compared using a monocular camera onboard a small drone. Several experiments were carried out in a greenhouse and a dairy farm barn with the absolute trajectory and the relative pose error being analyzed. It was found that the approach that suits best these workspaces is ORB-SLAM. This algorithm was tested by performing waypoint navigation and generating maps from the clustered areas. It was shown that aerial VSLAM could be achieved within these workspaces and that plant and cattle monitoring could benefit from using affordable and off-the-shelf drone technology. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Intensive livestock farming has become indispensable to meet the rapidly increasing demand for animal-based nutrition in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where antimicrobials are frequently used for treatment and prophylactic or metaphylactic purposes. However, very little is known about the trends of antimicrobial use (AMU) in dairy animals in LMICs. The objective of this study was to quantify AMU in two large commercial dairy farms in Pakistan. A retrospective study was conducted at two large corporate commercial dairy farms located in Punjab province for the year 2018. AMU was calculated using three metrics: active ingredient (AI; kg) and milligrams per population unit (mg/PU; mg/kg), which quantifies the amount of AI used, and antimicrobial treatment incidence (ATI; DDDA/1,000 cow-days), which estimates the per-day number of treatments to 1,000 cows. Total on-farm AMU was found to be 138.34 kg, 65.88 mg/kg, and 47.71 DDDA/1,000 cow-days. Measured in ATI, aminoglycosides (11.05 DDDA/1,000 cow-days), penicillins (8.29 DDDA/1,000 cow-days), and tetracyclines (8.1 DDDA/1,000 cow-days) were the most frequently used antimicrobial classes. A total of 42.46% of all the antimicrobials used belonged to the critically important antimicrobials for human medicine as defined by the World Health Organization. Considerably high AMU was found compared to other farm-level studies across the world. This was the first study to quantify AMU in the dairy industry in Pakistan. Our results showed that corporate commercial dairy management practices are associated with increased antimicrobial consumption and highlight the need for antimicrobial stewardship programs to encourage prudent use of antimicrobials in commercial dairy. © Copyright © 2020 Umair, Abdullah, Aslam, Nawaz, Ali, Fatima, Ali, Zahoor and Mohsin.},

	abstract = {The meat industry is influenced by technological developments which should be accepted by the stakeholders/consumers’ and it should be feasible as consumers’ preferences are one of the most important factors. Technology plays a crucial role across the entire lifecycle of a product, and communicating it in a translucent way is significant for building brand loyalty. Adapting to new technology can be game-changing and a thorough, in-depth view of a technology space is needed to make the right decision. Technology landscaping involves examining and outlining the landscape for technology by uncovering trends, research gaps, overlaps, and links and is also helpful for directing research and developing strategy. Technology landscape maps can help to build awareness of strategic technologies and identify opportunities at the intersection of emerging technologies and customer needs. Today with modern disruptive technologies, the food industry is booming. While the meat industry was a late adopter, companies are currently seeking to transform themselves digitally through better data collection and more control over their machinery. Technology landscaping has provided the best solutions to the existing problems in the meat sector. The recent Industry 4.0 technologies like Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of things, Blockchain Technology, and Robotics are being used in the livestock sector to enhance farm automation, clean meat production, and transparency throughout the supply chain right from the manufacturer to the end-users. Despite having these all-lucrative advantages of emerging technologies in the food sector; the adoption of technology is at a very slow pace. The main reason behind this is the higher initial investment, paucity of skilled manpower, and maintenance of relevant protocols. Another thing is majority of meat processors are small and medium-sized organizations. Technology has the potential to change the competitive landscape in the market and as technology disrupts the market there will also be discontinuation of the present market structure. © 2021, ACS Publisher.

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, the dairy industry has adopted the use of Automatic Milking Systems (AMS). AMS have the potential to increase the effectiveness of the milking process and sustain animal welfare. This study assessed the state of the art of research activities on AMS through a systematic review of scientific and industrial research. The papers and patents of the last 20 years (2000–2019) were analysed to assess the research tendencies. The words appearing in title, abstract and keywords of a total of 802 documents were processed with the text mining tool. Four clusters were identified (Components, Technology, Process and Animal). For each cluster, the words frequency analysis enabled us to identify the research tendencies and gaps. The results showed that focuses of the scientific and industrial research areas complementary, with scientific papers mainly dealing with topics related to animal and process, and patents giving priority to technology and components. Both scientific and industrial research converged on some crucial objectives, such as animal welfare, process sustainability and technological development. Despite the increasing inter-est in animal welfare, this review highlighted that further progress is needed to meet the consumers’ demand. Moreover, milk yield is still regarded as more valuable compared to milk quality. There-fore, additional effort is necessary on the latter. At the process level, some gaps have been found related to cleaning operations, necessary to improve milk quality and animal health. The use of farm data and their incorporation on herd decision support systems (DSS) appeared optimal.

	abstract = {Through automation with information technology, agriculture can be made smart using the Internet of Things (IoT). Nowadays, the application of IoT is widening and developing fast using sensor networks. Using IoT, the temperature, weather, soil activities, crop monitoring, moisture, inventory monitoring, and livestock status can be determined for analysis and necessary action. Using the proposed mechanism, the farmer can be directly connected to the farm and warehouse worldwide. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used to establish connections to monitor large warehouses and cultivation fields, where microcontrollers are used to control and automate the entire process. Similarly, wireless cameras can be used to view the live status remotely. Many crops die at different places due to weather and other natural calamities. Also, sometimes the crops do not get as much grain as per expectations. Sometimes the grains stored at the warehouse also need to be monitored, as they will be wasted after a long time without care. The huge loss of property due to hazards can only be reduced if there is prior information regarding the reason for damage. A combined approach with the Internet and WSN communications is proposed, with the major objective to collect real-time data of the agriculture production environment and warehouse. This provides easy access to agricultural facilities through alerts, advice on weather pattern and crops, and analytical results regarding the warehouse to make necessary arrangements for minimum wastage. To achieve live monitoring of real-time data of a farm, a smart system SAW has been discussed in which sensors regularly detect the surrounding data and send the values to the microcontroller. Different actions can be carried out by concerned authorities with the help of the GSM module. Disaster management teams can also be contacted to inform them in an emergency so that they can reach the place as early as possible and the damage can be reduced. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {During using biogas as fuel for diesel engines, it is necessary to clean it from hydrogen sulfide, water and carbon dioxide, as well as to compressing it to fill cylinders more efficiently. Today the production of biogas in agriculture is the disposal of crop waste and manure from livestock farms.This approach is very actual, at the first stage of its implementation was planned to create the necessary material and technical base to widespread using of non-traditional energy sources, including organic biomass energy (fertilizer, crop waste, etc.). In addition, environmental protection, which also requires intensive and rational processing of animal waste, is very closely connected with the problem of waste disposal. This necessitates the search for processing methods that would ensure the comprehensive utilization of its agricultural, energy, feed and other properties. This article presents the technology for processing the utilization of manure using microbial synthesis. When processing manure in anaerobic conditions, the threshold lowered for its smell, germination of weed seeds, helminths die, and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) are completely preserved. The resulting biological gas contains up to 70 % methane, and its calorific value is 24 MJ/M3. The introduction of low-waste, resource-saving technologies with mechanization and automation of production processes plays an important role in the environment protection issues from livestock complexes waste in their further development. At present, there are several directions of processing of agricultural and water waste. At the same time, processing of animal waste with the use of biogas plants gives a significant socio-economic effect, expressed in improving working conditions, increasing the production culture and land use. Moreover, the environment protection rask is being solved. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

The findings revealed that the agricultural business sector is open to implementing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions, so the aim of this paper is to determine how advantageous it is for Romanian farmers to invest in a project that employs smart cattle farming methods that incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and the Internet of Things (IOT). An unstructured interview was used to gather empirical evidence during a focus group meeting. Analyzing the selected primary performance metrics, it was projected that the farm’s profitability would increase by 19 percent, productivity would increase by 21 percent, and the farm’s environmental impact would decrease by 22 percent. Automation and remote work would help minimize the farm’s worker burden while also making control panels, decision-making files, and data analysis more available. In order for the domain to be as prosperous as possible, farmers must be made aware of the benefits of using these emerging technologies for closing the gap between farmers and Information Technology (IT) solution providers, and this can be accomplished through continuous training for both farmers and their technology vendors. © 2021 by the authors.

Traditionally, these estimates are obtained through human visual estimation, either in-person or by counting images on a photo; however, these methods are costly both in terms of time and labor and are prone to subjectivity and bias. In contrast, automated methods can expedite the counting process and remove subjectivity and bias. To this end, a 2-stage method is presented here that uses computer vision and deep learning to identify the location of flies in digital images. The first stage segments the salient cow from all other parts of the image to remove flies on neighboring cattle from consideration. The second stage processes full-resolution patches of the original image and produces a heat map at the location of flies in the images. The method was trained on a set of 375 human-annotated images and tested on 120 images, where significant variation was observed amongst the human scorers. Counting results are compared to four separate human scorers and demonstrate that the neural network produces consistent results and that the method is reliable. Thus, the developed method can be used for monitoring changes in horn fly populations over time by anyone and allows for increased rigor and repeatability. An examination of individual images where the method was closest to and farthest from the human counts provides valuable insights regarding photographic processes that lead to success and failure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Water is an important nutrient, and its continuous provision is a critical welfare issue for cattle grazing arid and semiarid rangelands. Time and labor are needed to monitor water availability, and automated monitoring systems are a costly input on expansive rangeland pastures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of detecting water system failures using Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking and accelerometers, assuming the data could be monitored in real or near-real time. Water system failure was simulated in a 1 096-ha pasture in Arizona by placing metal panels around the only drinker for 4 h (0800−1200) on three occasions in 2018 and two occasions in 2019. Randomly selected cows (10 in 2018 and 23 in 2019) of the 120 cows in the pasture were tracked with GPS collars, and 7 (2018) and 10 (2019) of the tracked cows were fitted with triaxial accelerometers. Movement intensity measured by accelerometers was greater (P = 0.03) on the day of simulated water failure than on control days with available water. During simulated water failure, cows remained closer to water (P = 0.01) after approaching the drinker (< 150 m) compared with the control period the day prior. Cows typically went to the drinker, drank, and then traveled away from the drinker and rested. On simulated water-failure days, cows remained near the drinker (< 150 m from the tank) until the panels were removed and they could drink. Real-time GPS tracking with or without accelerometer data has the potential to remotely detect water system failure, which could reduce the time for managers to repair the water system and improve cattle well-being. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Laying hen house is an important part of livestock industries, particularly with an intensification scale of over 70% in China. Appropriate indoor temperature and relative humidity are also critical to the health of birds, production performance, and egg quality, further fully exploiting the excellent genetic features of modern laying hens. An automatic control system is, therefore, necessary to precisely predict the dynamic changes of indoor temperature and relative humidity for laying hen houses. An evaporative cooling pad system is the most popular used to increase the accuracy of the prediction model in laying hen houses in summer. However, most currently-used prediction models usually fail to consider the cooling variation of the evaporative cooling pad system. Particularly, it is also lacking to consider the humidified impact on the indoor temperature and relative humidity in laying hen houses. In this study, a novel hourly model was created to predict the annual indoor temperature and relative humidity, as well as its variation in laying hen houses. A mathematical model of cooling efficiency was also adopted to consider the quantitative influence of the evaporative cooling pad system on the indoor thermal and humid environment. A field experiment was then conducted to verify the model in Handan, Hebei Province of China in July 2019. Twenty-six points of indoor temperature and relative humidity were set for the field measurement. A hot-wire anemometer was utilized to monitor the airflow rate of exhaust fans. Meanwhile, an outdoor meteorological station was installed on the roof to continuously record the climatic parameters. Moreover, two cases were carried out in Wuhan City and Harbin City of China to evaluate the performance of the prediction model, thereby analyzing the influence of different climate conditions on the indoor environment of laying hen houses. Finally, the prediction model was used to clarify the difference of heat transfer in the steady and dynamic state for the building envelope on the indoor thermal and humid environment of laying hen houses. The accuracy of the prediction model was obtained between the constant and variable evaporative cooling efficiencies. The results demonstrated that the predicted values of indoor temperature and relative humidity were consistent with the field measured ones. Specifically, the overall average error of indoor temperature was 0.67℃, and the average error of indoor relative humidity was 3.1%. It was found that there was no temperature delay in summer and only one hour delay in winter. Temperature attenuation presented 0.36℃ in summer and 1.02℃ in winter, indicating a negligible effect due to the thermal inertia of the enclosure. The variation of dynamic cooling efficiency was contributed to the higher accuracy of the prediction model in the evaporative cooling pad system. For example, the predicted error of temperature reduced from 1.4℃ to 0.67℃, and the error of relative humidity from 5.4% to 3.1%, when the cooling efficiency was fixed at 80%. Consequently, this finding can provide potential theoretical guidance for building design and thermal environment control of laying hens houses, and further improve the production performance of laying hens. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {A considerable number of livestock farmers are still practising natural matting for their animals instead of the Artificial Insemination (AI) technique. This study aimed to determine the various insemination procedures being used by farmers and the reasons for their rejection or acceptance in rural areas of Punjab. A cross-sectional dataset of 400 randomly selected livestock herders from two purposefully selected districts, Rahim Yar Khan and Muzaffargarh, was used. We used Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) to apply crosstab and t-test to the collected data. Findings infer that the AI technique was preferred by 60.5% of farmers particularly for cows whereas 75% of farmers preferred the natural matting process for buffalo (75.0%). The quality of AI service provided by public and private technicians was rated at an average level. For the natural matting process of their animals’ farmers were heavily (73.8 %) dependent on fellow farmers for sourcing a bull. Farmers viewed both private and public sector technicians equally skilled in performing AI. However, the high cost of semen (x̄=4.07±1.17) and unskilled technicians (x̄=4.05±1.17) were the key obstacles in wake of the effectiveness of AI. Poor record of the bull (x̄=4.12±1.14) and non-availability of bull (x̄=3.93±1.23) were the prominent plights associated with natural matting. Statistically, a significant difference was found concerning the cost of insemination (t=16.058), breed type (t =20.403) and milk or meat production potential (t=24.480) while inseminating the cow or buffalo. This study concludes that it should be obligatory for the farmers to maintain a record of natural matting through the bull. For AI, semen quality should be ensured with the synergistic association among institutions. The concerned institutions must develop a strategy to eradicate unregistered and non-qualified quack technicians. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Changing the dependence on the traditional method of artificial detection, this paper proposes, develops and uses an Artificial Intelligence-based screening solution for sow estrus detection. Sow estrus call is one of the significant calls which can reflect the physiological conditions. This makes the recognition of sow estrus call an exceedingly challenging problem. This problem is addressed by investigating the distinctness of Mel spectrum in the sound system generated in estrus when compared to other pig sounds. To overcome the lack of sow estrus sounds training data, transfer learning is exploited. To reduce the risk of misdiagnosis we raise a two-pronged AI architecture, one is collecting and transmitting sound to the detector, the other is identifying calls in sow estrus diagnosis system. Results show the AI architecture can distinguish among sow estrus calls and other non-sow-estrus-calls. The performance is good enough to encourage a large-scale collection of labeled sow estrus call data to improve the generalization capability of the AI architecture. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The results revealed that except milk consumption remaining parameters showed negative trend as compared to before lockdown, and dairy co-operative has played a major role in maintaining the milk supply chain during lockdown. The major constraints perceived by the farmers during lockdown were accessed and it was observed that increase in price of feed and fodder followed by fear of corona were major problems. The delivery of livestock services viz. AI, treatment, livestock extension and vaccination by the private veterinary practitioners was accessed and compared before lockdown and during lockdown period. The results revealed that less number of cases attended during lockdown due to low response from farmers for availing the service from them, and fear of corona virus. © 2021 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

	abstract = {Predicting bull fertility is one of the main challenges for the dairy breeding industry and artificial insemination (AI) centers. Semen evaluation performed in the AI center is not fully reliable to determine the level of bull fertility. Spermatozoa are rich in active miRNA. Specific sperm-borne miRNAs can be linked to fertility. The aim of our study is to propose a combined flow cytometric analysis and miRNA profiling of semen bulls with different fertility to identify markers that can be potentially used for the prediction of field fertility. Sperm functions were analyzed in frozen-thawed semen doses (CG: control group) and high-quality sperm (HQS) fraction collected from bulls with different field fertility levels (estimated relative conception rate or ERCR) by using advanced techniques, such as the computer-assisted semen analysis system, flow cytometry, and small RNA-sequencing. Fertility groups differ for total and progressive motility and in the abnormality degree of the chromatin structure (P < 0.05). A backward, stepwise, multiple regression analysis was applied to define a model with high relation between in vivo (e.g., ERCR) and in vitro (i.e., semen quality and DE-miRNA) fertility data. The analysis produced two models that accounted for more than 78% of the variation of ERCR (CG: R2 = 0.88; HQS: R2 = 0.78), identifying a suitable combination of parameters useful to predict bull fertility. The predictive equation on CG samples included eight variables: four kinetic parameters and four DNA integrity indicators. For the HQS fraction, the predictive equation included five variables: three kinetic parameters and two DNA integrity indicators. A significant relationship was observed between real and predicted fertility in CG (R2 = 0.88) and HQS fraction (R2 = 0.82). We identified 15 differentially expressed miRNAs between high- and low-fertility bulls, nine of which are known (miR-2285n, miR-378, miR-423-3p, miR-191, miR-2904, miR-378c, miR-431, miR-486, miR-2478) while the remaining are novel. The multidimensional preference analysis model partially separates bulls according to their fertility, clustering three semen quality variable groups relative to motility, DNA integrity, and viability. A positive association between field fertility, semen quality parameters, and specific miRNAs was revealed. The integrated approach could provide a model for bull selection in AI centers, increasing the reproductive efficiency of livestock. © Copyright © 2021 Turri, Capra, Lazzari, Cremonesi, Stella and Pizzi.},

	abstract = {Technological changes have been happening in production facilities including food manufacturing industries in an ever-increasing rate. This includes advancement in data capture devices, signal processing, communication capabilities and automated process control systems such as Internet of Things. It is more challenging where production systems are highly reliant on automation and robotics. Remote performance monitoring and controls are becoming progressively vulnerable due to risks associated with cyber security and corporate espionage. May 2021 cyber-Attack forced JBS meats USA to pay 11m in ransom money to stop any further disruptions in services. This heavily impacted JBS global operations including JBS Australian food manufacturing facilities. Food production facilities in Australia have critical control points supported by smart technologies as part of their food safety management systems. Cyber-Attacks on production facilities could result in financial, operational, health and safety consequences. As survey by the Australian Cyber Security Centre in 2020 revealed that Australian small businesses are impacted by cybercime each year with a loss of 300m. To present the potential cyber security threats and their associated risk level, a case study is presented based on the processing and manufacture of meat products in Australia. From this case study, to protect the meat industries from attacks, we identify cyber security attacks and their possible mitigation strategies. This research shows cyber security attacks can severely affect Overall Equipment Effectiveness which motivate us to embed cyber security as an additional pillar in existing 8 pillars Total Productive Maintenance. If cyber security is added as additional pillar, it will improve the quality of end products and overall productivity of manufacturing industries.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Breed characterization in the livestock is important for the breeding program in the future. This research aimed to characterize Thin-tail sheep in the highland and lowland areas of Jambi Province based on 7 body measurements and body indices using multivariate analysis. Data were collected from 160 sheep consisted of 80 rams and 80 ewes from each area (320 sheep in total with 1-2 years old). The research showed that the principal component analysis (PCA) in this study was explained 65.84%-72.30% by body measurements and 78.23%-84.99% by body indices of the total phenotypic variance of animals. The body measurement of cannon circumference (CC) and body indices of area index (AI), relative cannon index (RCI), dactyl thorax index (DTI), conformation index (CI), and index of body weight (IBW) were selected as the discriminating variable for Thin-tail sheep in different areas. However, this study’s canonical correlation (rc) values were 0.44 for body measurements and 0.47 for body indices. Therefore, about 67.5% of Thin-tail sheep from the lowland area and 57.5% of Thin-tail sheep from the highland area can be characterized with body measurements. Hence, about 61.2% of Thin-tail sheep from the lowland area and 65.6% of Thin-tail sheep from the highland area can be characterized with body indices. Temperature, humidity, rainfall, and length of radiation in the highland areas are lower than in the lowland areas. The cluster analysis in four Thin-tail sheep populations revealed two clusters, i.e., cluster 1 consisted of Kerinci and Sungai Penuh and cluster 2 consisted of Muaro Jambi and Batanghari. It was concluded that about 60% of Thin-tail sheep could be characterized through their body indices. © 2021, Tropical Animal Science Journal. All Rights Reserved.},

It will send the surveyed information to the ground station and relief packages can be dropped at specific locations. The swarm consists of hybrid VTOL UAV’s capable of vertical take-off and landing in rough terrain, in the absence of a landing strip. The flight time achieved is greater than an hour with a range of 50 km, which is unattainable with a conventional multirotor. The automated operation is implemented by pre-programming the system with a framework specific to the application. A learning network can be implemented to allow for better efficiency of system in multiple disaster scenarios. Flight stabilization is done with the help of a system of redundant IMU sensors computed on an on-board computer. The UAS is capable of localization and navigating in GPS enabled environments as well as, GPS denied environments with the help of a GPS, compass and inertial navigation fused with Visual Odometry. We use PSO to implement the swarm UAV’s, it is required to mitigate mid-air collisions between UAV’s in airspace and allocate work among them. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Technologies are transforming the universe with the help of digitalization, where IoT is leading in digitalization in almost every field such as health care, agriculture, livestock management, smart houses, cities, renewable energy management, cyberspace environment, etc. 5G wireless technology is also playing a vital role in the management of these IoT devices due to its unique network virtualization functionality. Traditional agricultural methods are continuously changing due to the involvement of the emerging technologies. Food security and food safety are the big concerns in the recent years, and it is expected that up to 2050 world population will grow approximately 33% of the total world population. It is foremost required to adopt smart technology in farming that can help in maximizing food production with minimum cost. Smart farming is a key interest of the scientific community to increase the yield production with minimum cost because due to urbanization agriculture land is continuously depleted. Smart farming uses AI/ML techniques, IoT infrastructure devices, computer vision technology, and unmanned aerial or ground vehicles to maximize the yield productions with minimum production cost. The work embodied in this chapter is focused on how smart farming is digitally transforming using emerging technologies such as machine learning, IoT, computer vision, unmanned aerial vehicles. Several key challenges for the adopting smart farming are also discussed for providing sufficient information before actual implementation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

	abstract = {The microclimate of a pigsty is determined by the combination of temperature, relative humidity, chemical and mechanical composition of the air, which have a significant impact on animal productivity and must be maintained within strict limits due to the physiological needs and capabilities of animals. An appropriate ventilation system has been created to ensure the removal of air from the pigsty. The purpose of the study is to establish the dependence of the operating parameters of the automatic ventilation system on the air quality in the pigsty, taking into account the permissible concentrations of gases. The developed automatic ventilation system for polluted air intake is located in the middle of the livestock house under the ceiling and consists of a central air duct, to which air intake pipes are connected. Air intake pipes are placed in the middle above each pen where animals are kept. Intake dampers with servomechanisms, temperature, humidity, and air quality sensors are installed at the inlet of the air intake pipes. The outlet of the central air intake duct is connected to the exhaust fan. Intake dampers with servomechanisms and sensors of temperature, humidity, and air quality are connected to the control unit by electrical wires. As a result of analytical studies of the automatic ventilation system for polluted air intake from a pigsty, the conditions for its effective operation have been mathematically substantiated. The developed technique and the algorithm implemented based on the Mathematica software package allows calculating the area of holes that form intake dampers with servomechanisms in the air intake pipes. The distribution of velocities in the air intake pipes and the distribution diagram of the area of holes that form intake dampers with servomechanisms in the air intake pipes are determined taking into account the design and technological parameters of the ventilation system and the distribution of the gas concentration (carbon dioxide, ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide) over the pens.

A proof of concept of a physical human-robot interaction (pHRI)-based assistive strategy for an industrial meat cutting system is demonstrated which can be transferred to an exoskeleton later. We discuss how a robot can assist a human in pHRI, specifically in the context of an industrial project i.e for the meat cutting industry. We developed an impedance control-based system that enables a KUKA LWR robot to provide assistive forces to a professional butcher while simultaneously allowing motion of the knife (tool) in all degrees of freedom. We developed two assistive strategies—a force amplification strategy and an intent prediction strategy—and integrated them into an impedance controller. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Robotics and automation are rapidly becoming part of meat processing operations. Current automation of breaking down a carcass into primals relies on guidance from X-ray, inter-connected with robotised band-saws. While yielding very accurate cutting lines, the use of vision systems for guidance would be significantly more affordable. This work proposes a novel method that solves the annotation transfer between a 3D noise-free cut-ting line annotated on a CT acquired canonical model and a noisy target in the form of a point cloud acquired by RGB-D cameras. The proposed coarse-to-fine method initially aligns the posture of each body using a non-rigid deformation algorithm and then performs a local search to solve the surface correspondence which is later used to morph the template non-rigidly. We quantitatively assess the approach by benchmarking with multiple state-of-the-art algorithms on a public available human pose dataset. We also present a proof of concept evaluation on lamb carcasses.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects food supply chains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many global problems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate change, and weather disasters. It has known that technological opportunities are available for human beings to get out of these predicaments, solving the interconnections between food-water-energy-climate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation from traditional to digital. The aim of this review is to gain holistic solutions in a systematic view, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural digital transformation that will play role in sustainable development. The transition from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering agricultural and industrial revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital agriculture combined under precision agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are handled based on domains covering monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. Digital technologies are explained with application examples such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, decision support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, real-time monitoring systems tracking whole conditions of animals in livestock, the IoT-based irrigation and fertilization systems that help enhance the efficiency of irrigation processes and minimize water and fertilizer losses in agricultural fields and greenhouses, blockchain-based electronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones and robotics that reduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically. Moreover, renewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between technologies such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and energy production in rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and drip irrigation systems and environmental monitoring systems. As a result, for a sustainable future, technological innovations that increase crop productivity and improve crop quality, protect the environment, provide efficient resource use and decrease input costs can help us facing in agriculture of today overwhelm many the economic, social, and environmental challenges. © Ankara University, Faculty of Agriculture.},

	abstract = {Advances in robotics promote interest in applications in the poultry industry to reduce human labor; however, skeptics express concerns regarding potential animal stress stemming from poultry-robot interactions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the avoidance distance (AD), a parameter reflecting stress in an animal due to an approaching object, of broilers and laying hens to a human assessor and a robotic ground vehicle. ADs were determined for birds at different ages (2, 4, 6, and 8 week old broilers; 28, 47, and 66 week old brown hens; and 27, 46, and 70 week old white hens) in a commercial broiler house and two commercial cage-free hen houses. The poultry-robot ADs were determined at three robot operating speeds (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m s-1) and two operation frequencies (bi-weekly and daily, for broilers only). The results show that the overall poultry-human and poultry-robot ADs were, respectively, 48 to 82 cm and 83 to 110 cm for broilers, 54 to 87 cm and 114 to 131 cm for brown hens, and 71 to 76 cm and 92 to 99 cm for white hens when the birds experienced the robot on test days only. Broiler-robot ADs significantly decreased to 30 to 63 cm when the birds were exposed to the robot daily, reflecting less stress induced by the robot than by the human. Poultry ADs to the human and robot tended to decrease for older birds. Slower robot operating speeds led to shorter ADs for broilers at 6 and 8 weeks of age and for white hens at all ages but did not affect ADs for broilers at 2 and 4 weeks of age and brown hens at all ages. Slower robot operating speeds also reduced the bird fleeing speed (FS). It is concluded that the robot did not induce more stress than the human in the broilers. The baseline poultry-robot ADs obtained in this study provide valuable information for understanding poultry interactions with robots and may help optimize robot operations for application in the poultry industry. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.},

	abstract = {Water plays a crucial role in the agricultural field for food production and raising livestock. Given the current trends in world population growth, the urgent food demand that must be answered by agriculture highly depends on our ability to efficiently exploit the available water resources. Among critical issues, there is water management. Recently, innovative technologies have improved water management and monitoring in agriculture. Internet of Things, Wireless Sensor Networks and Cloud Computing, have been used in diverse contexts in agriculture. By focusing on the water management challenge in general, existing approaches are aiming at optimizing water usage, and improving the quality and quantity of agricultural crops, while minimizing the need for direct human intervention. This is achieved by smoothing the water monitoring process, by applying the right automation level, and allowing farmers getting connected anywhere and anytime to their farms. There are plenty of challenges in agriculture involving water: water pollution monitoring, water reuse, monitoring water pipeline distribution network for irrigation, drinking water for livestock, etc. Several studies have been devoted to these questions in the recent decade. Therefore, this paper presents a survey on recent works dealing with water management and monitoring in agriculture, supported by advanced technologies. It also discusses some open challenges based on which relevant research directions can be drawn in the future, regarding the use of modern smart concepts and tools for water management and monitoring in the agriculture domain. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Intense selection for a few desired traits has resulted in reduction of the effective population size (Ne) in most of the plant and livestock populations across the world. The objective of the research was to assess the impact of Ne on the genetic architecture of the population in a simulated data with variable Ne for general population under selection. Along with this, the estimate of Ne and its ratio to adult breeding population (NB) in the census data of small ruminants of India were also investigated. Results indicated that the average inbreeding (Fi¯) decreases with increase in Ne; similarly, increase in Fi¯ per generation was highest in population with lowest Ne. Correlation of estimated breeding value (EBV) with true breeding value (TBV) was not much affected with effective population size. An effective number of chromosome segments (Me) in the populations under selection were significantly affected by magnitude of Ne, with linear positive relation between Ne and Me. Results on livestock census data revealed that all the sheep and goat breeds have sufficiently large Ne based on derived and actual census data. The median for ratio of effective population size to adult census size in sheep breeds was 0.120 and for goat breeds was 0.131. Karnah and Poonchi sheep shares the status of endangered breeds due to a smaller number of breeding female population and hence need attention for conservation. The Ne was large in sheep and goat due to less selection pressure as a result of low coverage of breed improvement programs, availability of large number of breeding males, and absence of artificial insemination (AI) in the field flocks. The estimates of Ne and its ratio to the adult census size (NB) excluded several factors such as fluctuating population size and overlapping generations. Study revealed introspection from most of the industrial breeding programs on the issue of Ne for populations under selection. Similarly, in small ruminants, large Ne indicates huge genetic diversity and scope of improvement in the productivity in near future. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The paper analyses the prospects of applying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in agriculture of Sverdlovsk oblast. This topic is currently relevant, as in the context of the rapid technological development and various innovations in the digital sphere; there is still considerable uncertainty about using AI in agricultural production. During the preparatory phase, an analysis of publications in the Web of Science (WoS) allowed to identify the nature and scope of the application of AI technologies in agriculture. Relying on a survey of managers from 55 agricultural organizations, the study determines the problems and prospects of using AI technologies in the regional agriculture. The respondents claim it is appropriate to use AI technologies for producing livestock products (26.0 %) and ensuring animal welfare (18.5 %). Considering the application of such technologies, the respondents expect an increase in production (23.2 %) and a decrease in costs (20.3 %). More than half of the respondents express their belief that AI technologists will significantly change agricultural production, reducing low-skilled labour employment while creating new jobs in the intellectual sphere. However, a positive perception of AI technologies may be the reason for somewhat unrealistic expectations from their use. A large part of the surveyed managers (65.5 %) presumes that these technologies will increase the production profitability, even though only 9.8 % of the respondents are currently using them. The application of AI technologies in the regional agriculture is limited due to their high cost and the lack of funds. In order to overcome these constraints, it is necessary to increase state support and train staff. AI technologies will enable forecast accuracy in various areas of agriculture that will attract additional investments in the regional agriculture. Executive authorities can use the research results for creating programs of digital agriculture development. © 2020 Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {The meat industry has undergone substantial changes over the previous several decades due to development of new technologies in primary production (food animals on farm) - precision livestock farming, sensing systems; slaughter & dressing - automation and robotization; and meat processing - precision fermentation, 3-dimensional printed meat. The current, traditional meat inspection (ante-mortem and post-mortem), based on visual inspection, palpation and incision, had not been changed since the end of the nineteenth century. Although this traditional approach was effective at the time it was introduced for detection of classical zoonoses (brucellosis, tuberculosis, cysticercosis, anthrax infection), it was not fully efficient in terms of the current needs for consumer protection. Namely, public health hazards associated with meat are, nowadays, connected to zoonotic food (meat) borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes), faecally excreted by healthy animals, which are responsible for the majority of human illnesses attributed to meat consumption; traditional meat inspection cannot respond effectively to detect these food borne hazards, but can even increase cross-contamination due to palpation and/or incision procedures. Therefore, there is a need to develop a novel, modern meat inspection system which will be risk-and evidence-based - the meat safety assurance system or carcass safety assurance system. Such a modern system should be based on risk management and meat inspection protocols supported by analysis of Food Chain Information/Harmonised Epidemiological Indicators in the farm-to-chilled carcass continuum. © 2020 Authors.

	abstract = {Automation in livestock farm is developed for various monitoring and control services such as herd management, milk production, environmental control and behaviour monitoring. In such applications, automated systems are used in order to collect data on physiological and health conditions of the animals. Subsequently they are made available to the farmer, providing a general overview of the condition of the herd as well as detailed actions on herd management. However, a more advanced use of automation devices that take part in the production process without a direct human-control relies on the most advanced automation application in dairy production involves the use of robots or intelligent machines that are capable of interacting with their work environment. The present research was focused on the energy monitoring of a fully automated dairy farm, located in the Veneto region of Italy, including automatic: milking system (AMS), feeding system (AFS) and robotic scraper (ARS). The paper reports an analysis on performance indices to quantify improvements in the functionality of the automated systems, including energy consumption and man labour. Preliminary results have shown a reduction of energy consumption of at least 35% compared to conventional systems and, moreover, the energy consumption of the farm has become more regular, with the effect of a greater flexibility than conventional systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {Rising energy prices, air pollution, growing environmental problems, a significant amount of waste in agricultural complexes, farms, poultry farms, fish factories, food processing enterprises, meat processing plants, distilleries, etc. determine the relevance of the introduction of biogas plants. The progressive technology of biogas use opens up many-sided possibilities of its use for electricity production, for drying and cooling in the domestic sector, for heating residential and industrial premises, etc. Actual operation of biogas plants becomes in areas that do not have their own energy resources and depend entirely on other suppliers. The main advantage of their use is the reduction of methane emissions into the atmosphere, which provokes the greenhouse effect. Therefore, at present, many enterprises are actively developing and mastering the production of biogas plants of various capacities and purposes. A biogas plant is considered in the work and an algorithm and a method for automating elements of a biogas plant are proposed. Namely, starting the mixer motor, automatically controlling the temperature in the bioreactor, automatically starting the compressor, bleeding the gas from the bioreactor in case of pressure increase above the set values in the gas tank and bioreactor, forced ventilation of the room in case of gas leaks, as well as sound and light alarms. Using ONI PLR Studio software, a control program for the programmable logic relay PLR-S-CPU-1206 was developed, the language of function blocks (FBD) was used according to IEC 61131-3. Also, an improved approach to the design of the mixing device is proposed. It involves combining the advantages of known designs and having modernization by changing the angle of inclination of the upper and lower blades and special cutouts on the upper blades to prevent the occurrence of foam. © 2020 IEEE.},

In this paper we present an extremely simple quadruped robot, which is able to walk with no form of software or controller. Instead, individual leg movements are triggered directly by switches on each leg which detect leg loading and unloading. As the robot progresses, pitching and rolling movements of its body result in a gait emerging with a consistent leg movement order, despite variations in stride and stance time. This gait has similarities to the gaits used by walking primates and grazing livestock, and is close to the gait which was recently theorised to derive from animal body geometry. As well as presenting the design and construction of the robot, we present experimental measurements of the robot's gait kinematics and ground reaction forces determined using high speed video and a pressure mat, and compare these to gait parameters of animals taken from literature. Our results support the theory that body geometry is a key determinant of animal gait at low speeds, and also demonstrate that steady state locomotion can be achieved with little to no active control. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {A highly accurate ‘non-invasive quantitative embryo assessment for pregnancy’ (NQEAP) technique that determines embryo quality has been an elusive goal. If developed, NQEAP would transform the selection of embryos from both Multiple Ovulation and Embryo Transfer (MOET), and even more so, in vitro produced (IVP) embryos for livestock breeding. The area where this concept is already having impact is in the field of clinical embryology, where great strides have been taken in the application of morphokinetics and artificial intelligence (AI); while both are already in practice, rigorous and robust evidence of efficacy is still required. Even the translation of advances in the qualitative scoring of human IVF embryos have yet to be translated to the livestock IVP industry, which remains dependent on the MOET-standardised 3-point scoring system. Furthermore, there are new ways to interrogate the biochemistry of individual embryonic cells by using new, light-based methodologies, such as FLIM and hyperspectral microscopy. Combinations of these technologies, in particular combining new imaging systems with AI, will lead to very accurate NQEAP predictive tools, improving embryo selection and recipient pregnancy success. © 2020},

	abstract = {Several advantages would arise from the automated detection of pathologies of pig carcasses, including avoidance of the inherent risks of subjectivity and variability between human observers. Here, we develop a novel automated classification of two porcine offal pathologies at abattoir: a focal, localized pathology of the liver and a diffuse pathology of the heart, as cases in point. We develop a pattern recognition system based on machine learning to identify those organs that exhibit signs of the pathology of interest. Specifically, deep neural networks are trained to produce probability heat maps, highlighting regions on the surface of an organ potentially affected by a given condition. A final classification stage then decides whether a given organ is affected by the condition in question based on statistics computed from the heat map. We compare outcomes of automated classification with classification by expert pathologists. Results show the classification of liver and heart pathologies in agreement with an expert at levels comparable to, or exceeding, interexpert agreement. A system using methods such as those presented here has potential to overcome the limitations of human-based abattoir inspection, especially if this is based on visual-only inspection, and ultimately to provide a new gold standard for pathology. Note to Practitioners - The motivation for this article reflects the current requirement for visual-only inspection of livestock carcasses at slaughter houses and the need to provide a gold standard for recognition of carcass pathologies. Visual-only inspection is motivated by the need to reduce cross contamination between carcasses by manual palpation, but this leads to substantial variability in detection accuracy both within and between inspectors. This has significant public health implications. Here we present a system that comprises hardware to capture images of pig offal and software to analyze those images and identify cases of liver milk spots and hearts affected by pericarditis. It can classify high proportions of offal with accuracy comparable to that of veterinarians with extensive experience in pig pathology, thus demonstrating the potential to overcome the limitations of human-based abattoir inspection (especially if it is visual-only) and ultimately to provide a new gold standard. Our work is the first to address the automation of pig offal inspection, thus shedding light on the challenges associated with both appropriate image capture and successful image analysis, such as the need to cope with wide variations in the appearance of both normal and diseased organs, as well as different types of lesions and their impact on how much effort is required from experts in order to produce data needed to train the system. Future directions of work should include extending the system to identify more pathologies and implementing a real-time system to cope with production line speed. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Pork consumption grows about 5% per year in developing countries. Ensuring food safety within ethical standards of meat production is a growing consumer’ demand. The present study aimed to develop a model to predict stress in piglets based on the infrared skin temperature (IST) using machine learning and the paraconsistent logic. A total of 72 piglets (32 males and 40 females) from 1 to 52 days old had the infrared skin temperature recorded during the farrowing and nursery phases under different stress conditions (pain, cold/heat, hunger, and thirst). The assessment of the thermal images was done using an infrared thermography camera. Thermograms were taken at ambient air temperatures ranging from 24 to 30 °C. The minimum infrared skin temperature (IST min) and the maximum infrared skin temperature (ISTmax) and the piglet sex were used as attributes to find the stress conditions (target). The attributes considered in the analysis were classified using the data mining method. The imaging technique is subject to certain contradictions and uncertainties that require mathematical modeling. The paraconsistent logic was applied to extract the contradiction from the data. The stress condition that had higher accuracy in the detection was that predicted by the cold (100%) using the ISTmin, and ISTmin plus the piglet sex, and thirst (91%) using ISTmax and ISTmax plus the piglet sex. The highest prediction of hunger was found using ISTmin (86%). Although the model was precise in detecting those stresses, the other stressful conditions in piglets such as pain that had an accuracy equal or less than 50%. Results indicate a promising assessment of stress condition in piglets using infrared skin temperature. We suggest the inclusion of other attributes in the machine learning process to amplify the use of the model. © 2019},

The ambition with the novel Meat Factory Cell (MFC) concept is to provide the meat industry with a robust and flexible automation platform that is also relevant for smaller scale production. The MFC process deviates radically from conventional processing of pig carcasses after singeing. In MFC, the limbs are removed first. Then the dorsal muscles along the spinal axis from tail to head are removed with the column and rind in one meat cut, followed by removal of the viscera. Finally, the cut ribs and belly are removed. Such approaches to automation in pig abattoirs and cutting plants are highly needed in smaller scale production, and they should produce meat and offal as hygienically as conventional factories. This case study reports the evisceration of 37 pigs in 9 trials performed in 2019. Several approaches were tested with a prototype carcass holding unit. Evisceration could be undertaken without the need to cut through the gastrointestinal tract from tongue to rectum, reducing the probability of accidental faecal contamination of pork carcasses from the gut content. The Meat Factory Cell procedure is an advance towards automated evisceration of pig carcasses which is both simple and hygienic. The traditional separation of internal organs into a pluck set and a set of stomach and bowels was more prone to leakages.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study entailed the design and implementation of a computer vision system for cow individual feed intake measurement, based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models, and a low-cost RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue, Depth) camera. Individual feed intake of dairy cows is an important variable currently unavailable in commercial dairies. An RGB-D camera was positioned above the feeding area in an open cowshed. Feed intake was estimated by combining information from the RGB and depth images. Cow identification was conducted using the RGB image. Deep learning algorithms for identification and intake estimation were developed using CNN models. Data for CNN training were acquired by a specially developed automatic data acquisition system. A range of feed weights under varied configurations were collected over a period of seven days with the setup, which included an automatic scale, cameras, and a micro-controller. Test data for feed intake was acquired in an open cowshed research dairy farm, wherein the cows were fed Total Mix Ration (TMR). Images of cows eating over a period of 36 h provided the test data for cow identification. The system was able to accurately identify 93.65% of the cows. The amount of feed consumed, which ranged from 0 to 8 kg per meal, was measured with mean absolute and square errors (MAE and MSE) of 0.127 kg, and 0.034kg2 respectively. The analysis showed that the amount and diversity of data are important for model training. Better results were achieved for the model that was trained with high-diversity data than the model trained with homogeneous data (MAE of 1.025 kg, and MSE of 2.845 kg2 for a model trained on shadow conditions only). Additionally, the training analysis shows that the model based on RGB-D data shows better results than the model based on depth channel data without RGB (MAE of 0.241 kg, and MSE of 0.106 kg2). These results suggest the potential of low-cost cameras for individual feed intake measurements in advanced dairy farms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Two different inseminating semen doses were considered. Five pooled semen samples were divided into two subsamples and each of them were diluted to a ratio 1:1 (v:v) with a freezing extender composed of TCG or Cortalap® containing 16% of dimethylsulfoxide and 0.1 mol/L of sucrose. The extended semen was filled into 0.25 mL plastic straws and frozen above a liquid nitrogen surface. After thawing (50°C/10 seconds) we determined sperm motility, viability, membrane functionality, acrosome and DNA integrity. Our results showed that the Cortalap® extender significantly improved the in vitro post-thaw sperm quality, in comparison to TCG. When we compared the extenders in vivo, no significant differences in the reproductive performances were observed independently by inseminating doses used. In this study we demonstrated that Cortalap® extender can be used as an alternative to TCG. Thus, the Cortalap® being a ready to use extender, implies a reduction of time, mistakes and microbial contaminations during its preparation. This discovery results as significant because it provides beyond an important contribution to the creation of the first Italian semen cryobank of rabbit breeds and also for livestock rabbit farms based on artificial insemination (AI) program. © 2020 Michele Di Iorio et al., published by Sciendo 2020.},

In the western world, insects are not known as food. However, alternative protein sources are needed as the agricultural land available in the world is not enough to satisfy the growing demand of meat. Among those sources are algae, mycoproteins, cultured meat, plant proteins, and insects. The nutritional value of insects is comparable to meat products. The environmental impact from rearing insects is much less than livestock production: insects emit less greenhouse gases and need much less land and water. When insects are promoted as food, harvesting more from nature is not an option and they need to be farmed as mini-livestock. The interest in the western world to use insects as food is growing. This is exemplified by the exponential growth of the number of publications as well as the number of start-up companies. Major hurdles in western countries are the creation of a legislative framework, automation to reduce the cost price, and the development of strategies to convince consumers. Consumer strategies are: an affordable price, developing tasty products, incorporating insect ingredients in familiar products and to give consumer a taste experience. Producing insects as food may become a new agricultural sector. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

The method for analytical calculation of the productivity rate of meat cutting by a cutter with a screw tooth provides an accuracy for which relative error does not exceed 6%. The authors show automatic process control in minced meat production using a control system computer (CSC), with the aim of building an automatic control system (ACS) for chopping raw materials frozen in the form of blocks. The task of ACS synthesis was solved: the system structure and its elements were chosen, the topology of their cause-and-effect relationships and an algorithm of control devices were developed, and their parameters were determined. The ACS's control loop scheme for raw material cutting speed was realized, where an assembly of devices was chosen as the object of management (OM): the squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM) of the cutting mechanism drive; the frequency converter (FC) of the supply voltage, which changes the rotation speed of the SCIM (the rotation speed of the milling cutter); and the milling cutter of the chopper. The shaping filter method was used, to predict the size of the meat chips produced, to modulate the perturbation acting on the system from the load side. Based on the single-stage chopping of raw meat, an automatic line is created for producing meat products, with a minced meat quality management system based on artificial intelligence on the principle of ‘unmanned technology'. © 2020 Potravinarstvo Slovak Journal of Food Sciences, License: CCBY 3.0},

	abstract = {Accelerometers (neck- and leg-mounted) and ultra-wide band (UWB) indoor localization sensors were combined for the detection of calving and estrus in dairy cattle. In total, 13 pregnant cows and 12 cows with successful insemination were used in this study. Data were collected two weeks before and two weeks after delivery for calving. Similarly, data were collected two weeks before and two weeks after artificial insemination (AI) for estrus. Different cow variables were extracted from the raw data (e.g., lying time, number of steps, ruminating time, travelled distance) and used to build and test the detection models. Logistic regression models were developed for each individual sensor as well as for each combination of sensors (two or three) for both calving and estrus. Moreover, the detection performance within different time intervals (24 h, 12 h, 8 h, 4 h, and 2 h) before calving and AI was investigated. In general, for both calving and estrus, the performance of the detection within 2–4 h was lower than for 8 h-24 h. However, the use of a combination of sensors increased the performance for all investigated detection time intervals. For calving, similar results were obtained for the detection within 24 h, 12 h, and 8 h. When one sensor was used for calving detection within 24–8 h, the localization sensor performed best (Precision (Pr) 73–77%, Sensitivity (Se) 57–58%, Area under curve (AUC) 90–91%), followed by the leg-mounted accelerometer (Pr 67–77%, Se 54–55%, AUC = 88–90%) and the neck-mounted accelerometer (Pr 50–53%, Se 47–48%, AUC = 86–88%). As for calving, the results of estrus were similar for the time intervals 24 h-8 h. In this case, similar results were obtained when using any of the three sensors separately as when combining a neck- and a leg-mounted accelerometers (Pr 86–89%, Se 73–77%). For both calving and estrus, the performance improved when localization was combined with either the neck- or leg-mounted accelerometer, especially for the sensitivity (73–91%). Finally, for the detection with one sensor within a time interval of 4 h or 2 h, the Pr and Se decreased to 55–65% and 42–62% for estrus and to 40–63% and 33–40% for calving. However, the combination of localization with either leg or neck-mounted accelerometer as well as the combination of the three sensors improved the Pr and Se compared to one sensor (Pr 72–87%, Se 63–85%).

The traditional analysis of seminal quality includes the evaluation of concentration and motility (total and progressive), the parameters on which the number of doses producible from an ejaculate is calculated. The introduction of automated sperm evaluation systems based on computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) represented a revolution in the production of seminal doses and the knowledge in reproductive biology; however, this technology has been generally implemented without a critical analysis of its limitations and dependence on several methodological factors. In addition to the use of CASA technology, the estimation of kinematics and morphometry have been incorporated as novel parameters for sensitivity and reproducibility. AI has facilitated the rapid and universal dissemination of genetic material from a relatively small number of males. The CASA systems allow the analysis of a large number of sperm cells in a short time, thereby providing an array of quantitative data on kinematics and head sperm morphometry, thus making it possible to optimise the reliability of seminal analyses. © 2020 Polish Academy of Science.

	abstract = {This work aims to study the relationship between variations of the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) and the parameters of reproduction especially the first conception rate (FCR) and to determine the threshold THI value where cows’ fertility rate dropped in 12 Holstein dairy herds raised in the arid climatic conditions of Tunisia. THI values were calculated over 22 years (1996–2018), and the mean monthly temperature and relative humidity data were obtained from the Meteorological Institute of Tunisia. A total of 20,396 individual records (Insemination and calving dates) were extracted from the Livestock and Pasturing Office (OEP, Tunisia) with regard to the highest THI before breeding, on the breeding day, and after breeding. Statistical analysis was performed using the GLM procedure of SAS software. Results point to the fact that a summer heat stress exists in southeast Tunisia and lasts for 4 months starting from June until September with THI values fluctuating between 73 ± 2.38 and 79 ± 3.01 exceeding, therefore, THI threshold of 72. Increased THI from ≤70 to ≥80 units was associated with drops in conception rate (CR) and fertility rate (FR) of 49% and 45% giving a correlation with the THI of (r = −.72, p <.05) and (r = −.74, p <.05), respectively. When cows were inseminated on extremely hot days (THI ≥ 80) preceded by cooler temperatures, pregnancy by service (P/AI) was 7% points higher than for other cows that were exposed to high temperatures before breeding. The average number of insemination was higher (p <.05) from THI ≤ 70 (2.01) compared to THI ≥ 80 (3.41). Cows calving during an absence of heat stress (THI ≤ 70) have the shortest average calving intervals (CI: 420 ± 15.1 days). Contrastly, calving in the condition of heat stress (THI ≥ 80) has the longest CI (487 ± 12.8 days). For each point increase in the THI value above 67, there is a decrease in the first conception rate by 1.39%. In this particular arid environment, high-yielding Holstein cows’ breeding success is strongly affected by heat stress that takes place just before or after breeding. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

	abstract = {The transmission of pathogens across the interface between wildlife and livestock presents a challenge to the development of effective surveillance and control measures. Wild birds, especially waterbirds such as the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are considered to be the natural hosts of Avian Influenza (AI), and are presumed to pose one of the most likely vectors for incursion of AI into European poultry flocks. We have developed a generic quantitative risk map, derived from the classical epidemiological risk equation, to describe the relative, spatial risk of disease incursion into poultry flocks via wild birds. We then assessed the risk for AI incursion into British flocks. The risk map suggests that the majority of AI incursion risk is highly clustered within certain areas of Britain, including in the east, the south west and the coastal north-west of England. The clustering of high risk areas concentrates total risk in a relatively small land area; the top 33% of cells contribute over 80% of total incursion risk. This suggests that targeted risk-based sampling in a relatively small geographical area could be a much more effective and cost-efficient approach than representative sampling. The generic nature of the risk map method, allows rapid updating and application to other diseases transmissible between wild birds and poultry. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study analyzes different factors that affect the success of artificial insemination of cows by small farmers involved in a productive and genetic improvement program in the O´Higgins region of central Chile. The success of artificial insemination was modeled as a function of different biological, environmental, and social factors recorded by the program using logistic regression. The model output was the gestational status of the inseminated cows as diagnosed by ultrasound. All predictors were evaluated for unconditional associa-tions with the outcome. The results showed that the pregnancy probabilities in cows from Cardenal Caro Province were higher than those from Cachapoal Province; inseminators with 10 or more years of experience had greater pregnancy success than those with 1-4 years of experience; the pregnancy odds decreased on farms with 30 or more cows compared with farms with 1 to 5 cows; and the pregnancy odds also decreased when AI was performed at a fixed time compared with heat detection. Thus, the province, the number of cows in the herd, the experience of the inseminators, and the type of insemination were associated with the success of the pregnancy. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo.

Temperature and humidity are major parameters for thermal balance. In spite of available automation technology, poultry farming is still dependent on an expert to observe the process and set up control parameters accordingly. Besides being inefficient, this is also uncomfortable and error-prone. This article proposes a framework for control, supervision, and decision-making in poultry farming. We initially set up a plant architecture that enables us to take advantage of emerging modern technologies, such as sensor networks, control theory, and remote monitoring, to handle temperature and humidity inside a poultry house. Then, we present the steps of modelling, synthesis, and implementation of a controller that observes events in the plant and commands the actuators in a minimally restrictive, controllable and non-blocking way, while complying with a set of operational requirements. Our final result provides a dual-channel web-based supervision system that shows the process status remotely for users and allows them to interfere with control, whenever convenient. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The present study was purposively conducted in native tract of Gangatiri cattle in Uttar Pradesh. The information were collected from 108 respondents, who were rearing Gangatiri cattle for their livelihood. It was observed that most (53.70%) of the respondents practicing 6-10 hrs grazing of their Gangatiri herd. All the farmers were providing natural service to cows in estrus, maximum number of them (54.63%) between 12 to 16 hrs after detection of estrus and 53.70 per cent of them with bulls available in village surroundings. Maximum number of respondents (35.20%) initially used indigenous knowledge for disease treatment and after that consulted with veterinary doctor/stockman. Major diseases prevelant in the area include FMD, HS, BQ and mastitis. Gangatiri cows were found to be more resistance to the diseases and heat tolerant as compared to crossbred cattle. Majority (81.48%) of respondents kept their cattle on kachcha floor in good sanitary conditions. About 70.37% respondents made cattle shed as a part of their houses. Majority (59.25%) of the cattle owners were using knuckling method of milking, which may be a cause of mastitis in animals. It can be concluded that there is need of awareness programmes on scientific cattle rearing practices and interventions like supply of semen of bulls of high genetic merit under AI programme or bulls of good genetic merit for natural breeding, adequate grazing land and inputs for health management practices are needed to make the Gangatiri cattle rearing more beneficial. © 2020 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {Digitalisation is an integral part of modern agriculture. Several digital technologies are available for different animal species and form the basis for precision livestock farming. However, there is a lack of clarity as to which digital technologies are currently used in agricultural practice. Thus, this work aims to present for the first time the status quo in Swiss livestock farming as an example of a highly developed, small-scale and diverse structured agriculture. In this context, the article focuses on the adoption of electronic sensors and measuring devices, electronic controls and electronic data-processing options and the usage of robotics in ruminant farming, namely, for dairy cattle, dairy goats, suckler cows, beef cattle and meat-sheep. Furthermore, the use of electronic ear tags for pigs and the smartphone usage for barn monitoring on poultry farms was assessed. To better understand the adoption process, farm and farmer's characteristics associated with the adoption of (1) implemented and (2) new digital technologies in ruminant farming were assessed using regression analyses, which is classified at a 10% adoption hurdle. The results showed clear differences in the adoption rates between different agricultural enterprises, with both types of digital technologies tending to be used the most in dairy farming. Easy-to-use sensors and measuring devices such as those integrated in the milking parlour were more widespread than data processing technologies such as those used for disease detection. The husbandry system further determined the use of digital technologies, with the result that farmers with tie stall barns were less likely to use digital technologies than farmers with loose housing systems. Additional studies of farmers’ determinants and prospects of implementation can help identify barriers in the adoption of digital technologies. © 2020 The Animal Consortium},

	abstract = {Automatic animal monitoring can bring several advantages to the livestock sector. The emergence of low-cost and low-power miniaturized sensors, together with the ability of handling huge amounts of data, has led to a boost of new intelligent farming solutions. One example is the SheepIT solution that is being commercialized by iFarmtec. The main objectives of the solution are monitoring the sheep's posture while grazing in vineyards, and conditioning their behaviour using appropriate stimuli, such that they only feed from the ground or from the lower branches of the vines. The quality of the monitoring procedure has a linear correlation with the animal condition capability of the solution, i.e., on the effectiveness of the applied stimuli. Thus, a Real-Time mechanism capable of identifying animal behaviour such as infraction, eating, walking or running movements and standing position is required. On a previous work we proposed a solution based on low-power microcontrollers enclosed in collars wearable by sheep. Machine Learning techniques have been rising as a useful tool for dealing with big amounts of data. From the wide range of techniques available, the use of Decision Trees is particularly relevant since it allows the retrieval of a set of conditions easily transformed in lightweight machine code. The goal of this paper is to evaluate an enhanced animal monitoring mechanism and compare it to existing ones. In order to achieve this goal, a real deployment scenario was availed to gather relevant data from sheep's collar. After this step, we evaluated the impact of several feature transformations and pre-processing techniques on the model learned from the system. Due to the natural behaviour of sheep, which spend most of the time grazing, several pre-processing techniques were tested to deal with the unbalanced dataset, particularly resorting on features related with stateful history. Albeit presenting promising results, with accuracy over 96%, these features resulted in unfeasible implementations. Hence, the best feasible model was achieved with 10 features obtained from the sensors’ measurements plus an additional temporal feature. The global accuracy attained was above 91%. Howbeit, further research shall assess a way of dealing with this kind of unbalanced datasets and take advantage of the insights given by the results achieved when using the state's history. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Avian influenza (AI) has severely affected the poultry industry worldwide and has caused the deaths of millions of birds. Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is characterized by high mortality and the ability to transmit from birds to humans. Early diagnosis is difficult because of the variation in pathogenicity and the genetic diversity between virus subtypes. Therefore, development of a sensitive and accurate diagnostic system is an urgent priority. We developed ssDNA aptamer probes to detect AI viruses. Through seven rounds of SELEX to search for a probe specific to the highly pathogenic AI virus subtype H5N1, we identified 16 binding aptamers and selected two with the highest binding frequency. These two aptamers had strong binding affinities and low detection limits. We found that they could bind more specifically to H5N1, as compared to other subtypes. Furthermore, these aptamers inhibited hemagglutination, which is caused by the virus surface protein hemagglutinin. Our results indicate that our screened aptamers are effective molecular probes for diagnosing H5N1 and can be used as therapeutic agents to inhibit viral surface proteins. Sensitive diagnosis and suppression of avian influenza will help maintain a stable and healthy livestock industry, as well as protect human health. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are a large class of single-cell prokaryotes capable of oxygen-producing photosynthesis. When cyanobacteria are stimulated by nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements, it will cause eutrophication of the water body and cause the phenomenon of 'bloom' in the lake, which seriously endangers the safety of humans, livestock, fish and shrimp. The monitoring and management of cyanobacteria blooms have been plagued by lake management units. At present, the product functions related to the prevention and control of cyanobacteria blooms are very single. The product functions are roughly divided into two categories, some of which focus only on the monitoring link and the other only focus on the salvage and processing link. There is no one product that can combine the two links well. In view of this situation, this article has designed and developed a set of cyanobacteria and algae prevention and control disposal management system, which effectively combines the monitoring and salvage links. The system includes four subsystems: operation report subsystem, monitoring data management system, algae mud environmental protection whole process management system and real-time cyanobacteria monitoring system. The three-dimensional interaction between the WEB terminal and the mobile terminal makes the system more efficient and convenient. The system has the following two innovations: Innovation one: Effectively integrate the control and salvage links of cyanobacteria blooms and jointly build them into a system. Innovation point 2: Apply the K-means algorithm in machine learning to image classification, and replace artificial artificial unattended with AI to improve the recognition rate and reduce the error rate. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In cattle, sex selection has a significant economic impact when it improves herd capacity of milk or meat production and is commonly used for the production of calves of the desired gender. New separation techniques which present both better accuracy and low costs are necessary. Density gradient centrifugation might be an approach to sexing spermatozoa because of the additional DNA content and volume of X-bearing sperm head. The present study was designed to apply the modified percoll discontinuous density gradient for X-sperm enrichment in cross bred bovine semen. We attempted to amplify the level of X-sperm enrichment by using double centrifugation in percoll gradient. In addition, effect of percoll density gradient on fertility of semen was also evaluated at three stages; before centrifugation (stage I), after 1stcentrifugation (stage II) and after 2ndcentrifugation (stage III) respectively and ultrasonography was carried out to confirm the sex of fetus at 60-90 days post AI. Semen was collected from two cross bred bovine bulls and 34 cows were inseminated with liquid X-sperm enriched semen after double centrifugation in percoll gradient. 22 cows were inseminated with nonsexed fresh liquid semen (control). Results showed that the volume, progressive motility, live sperms, concentration and HOST reactive sperms significantly (P<0.05) decreased at stage II and stage III compared to stage I. However, no significant (P>0.05) change was observed in pH and mass motility of semen at all three stages. There was non-significant effect on per cent spermatozoa with intact acrosomal membrane and fully damaged acrosomal membrane at all three stages however, partially damaged acrosomal membrane sperms were significantly (P<0.05) decreased at Stage II and Stage III compared to Stage I. The conception rate significantly (P<0.05) decreased with X-enriched semen (41.17%) compared to non-sexed liquid semen (59.09%). The female sex ratio of calves significantly (P<0.05) increased to 66.66% with X-sperm enriched semen compared to the male percentage of 33.33% with sexed semen and female percentage of 46.15% with non-sexed semen. © 2020 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {Nowadays, many of the processes carried out in livestock farms have been technified and automated, improving their performance and profitability. However, despite the fact that this technification has taken place in most livestock sectors, the sheep sector still have less resources than other species to apply these technological improvements. As a result, tasks that are fully automated in other species, are still carried out in the traditional way on sheep farms. Currently, one of the biggest problems detected within this sector is the difficulty of the farmer in weighing lambs. Weighing them through a roman scale or dynamometer is a difficult task on a physical level that generates too much stress on the animal. This causes that many farmers decide to dispense with weighing and estimate the weight at first sight. The aim of this study is to generate an algorithm by means of different morphometric measurements of the lamb which can establish a correlation between some of these measurements and the weight of the animal. The purpose of this algorithm will be to develop a device that helps the farmer in the weighing process and increases animal welfare. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee AEIPRO, Spain},

	abstract = {Animal reproduction is an integral component for a sustainable livestock production. Enhancing the reproduction potential of animals without compromising the welfare would lead towards sustainable animal production. Careful attention adopting technological interventions would result to efficient performance and guarantees profit and sustainability. In the tropical environment, the effect of heat stress, food and water scarcity during summer affects the reproduction performance in most livestock species. Low expression of estrus, poor libido, incidence of abortion especially during prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, and embryonic death are among the problems that compromised reproductive efficiency. Through advance reproductive biotechnologies and management innovations and interventions, these problems could be controlled. The application of reproductive biotechnology tools such as estrus synchronization (ES), artificial insemination (AI), embryo transfer (ET) through multiple ovulation and in vivo collection of embryos, in-vitro embryo production (IVEP) and cryopreservation, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to produce the desired breed and sex of animal, and other reproductive biotechnologies that enhances reproduction potential are important innovations that can address specific needs and purpose for animal reproduction. The strategies, innovations, and important practices in the application of these reproductive tools and interventions are presented and discussed considering the welfare of the animals for a sustainable livestock production in a tropical environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Confirmation of the disease is through culture and verification of the causative agent by molecular tests. In this study, we assessed the utility of the Xpert ® MTB/RIF Ultra assay, an automated molecular test originally designed to improve the detection of tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance in clinical sputum samples of human origin, by conducting a comparative evaluation with a culture based method routinely used at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Research (OVR). A total of 167 samples (tissue, n = 165; pus, n = 1; abscess, n = 1) from different wildlife and livestock animals (from 65 individual animals) were analyzed. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex species was isolated in 63 (37.72 %) of the 167 samples, and was detected in 79 (47.3 %) of the samples by Xpert ® MTB/RIF Ultra assay. Based on the standard culture test, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert ® MTB/RIF Ultra assay was found to be 95.24 % and 82 % respectively. All animals that were confirmed bTB positive by culture method were also found to be positive with the Xpert ® MTB/RIF Ultra assay in at least one sample (indicating a 100 % sensitivity of the method at the animal level). Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were isolated in 9 (3.4 %) of the samples analysed and none were detected by Xpert ® MTB/RIF Ultra assay, highlighting that this molecular test is highly specific. Xpert ® MTB/RIF Ultra assay was found to have great potential for the rapid diagnosis of the bTB in animals, hence allowing early intervention by regulatory authorities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was designed to evaluate the association between thermoregulatory responses, hormonal, hematological and serum biochemical values features aiming to propose an adaptability index (AI) for dairy cows under tropical conditions. Thirty adult dairy cows were used, including 15 Sindi and 15 Girolando breeds with mean weight of 338.52 ± 42.79 kg and 487.54 ± 60.67 kg, respectively. These data included rectal temperature (RT) and respiratory rate (RR). For the serum of blood sample, the levels of glucose (GLU), cholesterol (CHO), triglycerides (TRI), total protein (TP), creatinine (CRE), albumin (ALB), urea (URE), aspartate aminotrasferase (AST) and alanine aminotrasferase (ALT) and hormonal concentrations (triiodothyronine – T3 and thyroxine – T4). For the total blood samples were analyzed for hematology variables: red blood cell count (RBC); hemoglobin concentration (HC); packet cell volume (PCV); mean corpuscular volume (MCV); white blood cell (WBC). The AI was development using multivariate analysis to “weigh” the influence of each variable in the animal responses. The variables more important for adaptive aspects of Sindi and Girolando cows were respectively: GLU; MCV; AST; PCV; RBC; HE; TP; ALB; ALT; RR; T4; RT; T3; URE; CHO; TRI; CRE; WBC and ALB; GLU; TP; AST; RR; ALT; CRE; CHO; RT; RBC; T4; HE; PCV; MCV; URE; TRI; WBC; T3. The difference between breeds was just over 8% for AI. We developed a preliminary AI, able to measure the level of adaptability of dairy cows under tropical region. The methodological framework has potential to inform decision-makers on the adaptability animal conditions and high inference of the blood values from adaptability of cows. © 2020},

	abstract = {Predicting the drivers of incursion and expansion of vector-borne diseases as part of early-warning strategies (EWS) is a major challenge for geographically extensive diseases where spread is mediated by spatial heterogeneity in climate and other environmental drivers. Geospatial data on these environmental drivers are increasingly available affording opportunities for application to a predictive disease ecology paradigm provided the data can be synthesized and harmonized with fine-scale, highly resolved data on vector and host responses to their environment. Here, we apply a multi-scale big data–model integration approach using human-guided machine learning to objectively evaluate the importance of a large suite of spatially distributed environmental variables (>400) to develop EWS for vesicular stomatitis (VS), a common viral vector-borne vesicular disease affecting livestock throughout the Americas. Two temporally and phylogenetically distinct events were used to develop disease occurrence–environment relationships in incursion (2004) and expansion years (2005), and then to test those relationships (2014, 2015) at two scales: (1) local and (2) landscape to regional. Our results show that VS occurrence at a local scale of individual landowners was related to conditions that can be monitored (rainfall, temperatures, streamflow) or modified (vegetation). On-site green vegetation during the month of occurrence and higher rainfall four months prior combined with either cool daytime (expansion) or nighttime (incursion) temperatures one month prior were indicators of VS occurrence. Distance to running water (incursion) and host density based on neighboring ranches (expansion) with infected animals were also important in individual years. At landscape-to-regional scales, conditions that favor specific VSV biological vectors were indicated, either black flies in incursion years or biting midges in expansion years. Changes in viral genetic lineage were less important to patterns in VS occurrence than factors affecting the host–vector–environment interactions. In combination with our onset map based on latitude, elevation, and long-term annual precipitation, this year- and scale-specific information can be used to develop strategies to minimize effects of future VS events. This big data approach coupled with expert knowledge and machine learning can be applied to other emerging diseases for improvement in understanding, prediction, and management of vector-borne diseases. © 2020 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Agricultural production is a large consumer of thermal energy for various processes. Heat is necessary to maintain the microclimate on livestock farms in the cold season. Previous studies have reported that heat recovery of ventilation air can reduce thermal energy consumption by up to 40–60%. However, most of these studies were retrospective and descriptive in nature and they did not take into account the peculiarities of agricultural production technologies. The energy-saving method of microclimate support for livestock farms of a decentralized type is described. It is based on the principles of exhaust air heat recovery, ozonation and deep air recirculation. The article deals with the structural and technological schemes of the ventilation-heating device implementing this method. The main statements of calculation methods including the thermal-power, electrical and structural calculations are described. Polyethylene terephthalate film is used as heat exchange surface. The design constant of the heat exchanger is 180 W/°C. Exergy efficiency for the heat exchanger equal to 0.48 relative units. An expression was obtained to determine the convective heat transfer coefficient in the electric supply air heater. Corona discharge ozonator is used for purification and disinfection of circulating air. The experimental stand is used for automated registration, transfer, processing and storage of data. The results of experiments confirming the energy efficiency of the electrothermal installation are reflected on the charts. The implementation of the described method provides reduction of energy consumption up to 55%. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In modern livestock breeding, raising the density of animals as well as the degree of mechanization and automation of manufacturing processes leads to greater biological and technical burden on the housing. Biological burden depends not only on the number of animals per unit area, but also on the intensity of physiological processes and metabolism in highly productive animals. These features of industrial livestock production require special microclimate in livestock housing. The microclimate solution such includes important indicators as light, temperature, humidity, air velocity and others. According to zootechnical and sanitary requirements to keeping dairy cows, all microclimate parameters in the housing must be strictly maintained within established norms. These microclimate studies were conducted at the AP Solovievskoye farm in Knyagininsky District of Nizhny Novgorod Region, Russia. The studies focused on two types of cattle houses, the first, made of the assembled concrete semi-frames with a glass apex in the roof, the second made of assembled concrete semi-frames without a glass apex, both designed for 200 animals. The average air temperature in the house with the glass apex was 5.7 °C at the end of the building. This is below the norm, which is 8–12 °C in winter. In the central part of the building, the temperature was higher by 1.1 °C. The air circulation velocity in both houses was insufficient, which has a significant effect on the heat transfer in the dairy cows, while in winter, the increased air circulation causes hypothermia in animals’ bodies. The results obtained can be used to modernize the livestock complex. Dairy products of cows are often used only by 20–30% due to unsatisfactory zoo-hygienic conditions. Therefore, creating an optimal microclimate is an important reserve for increasing the production of high-quality products. © 2019 SERSC.},

It has been established that the use of the visible spectrum of artificial light emission with an adjustable amount of light does not adversely affect the cows' organism, but rather stimulates its activity, which contributes to more abundant feed consumption and an increase in milk yield, and, accordingly, a reduction in production costs.

The standard practice of storing and transporting bovine semen uses liquid nitrogen (LN), a scarce commodity in many regions of the world.

We developed equipment that dispenses dry ice from widely available liquid carbon dioxide (LCO2) tanks into an easily transportable device. In vivo fertility results with a dry ice cold chain showed no statistical difference to the conventional LN method. In vitro bovine semen analyses also showed that storage under these conditions minimally affects characteristics associated with fertility.

In addition, an integrated camera system with a neural network can assist in assessing the constitution of mealworms by using the segments of the larvae for evaluation. Regarding the processing of mealworm larvae, it has been shown that duration of drying and temperature have a significant influence on the nutritional value and quality of the larvae.

Infrared thermography (IRT) is one such technology that has been used for monitoring animal health and welfare and, through automation, has the potential to be integrated into automated systems on-farm. This study reports on an automated system for collecting thermal infrared images of calves and on the development and validation of an algorithm capable of automatically detecting and analysing the eye and cheek regions from those images. Thermal infrared images were collected using an infrared camera integrated into an automated calf feeder. Images were analysed automatically using an algorithm developed to determine the maximum eye and cheek (3 × 3-pixel and 9 × 9-pixel areas) temperatures in a given image. Additionally, the algorithm determined the maximum temperature of the entire image (image maximum temperature). In order to validate the algorithm, a subset of 350 images analysed using the algorithm were also analysed manually. Images analysed using the algorithm were highly correlated with manually analysed images for maximum image (R2 = 1.00), eye (R2 = 0.99), cheek 3 × 3-pixel (R2 = 0.85) and cheek 9 × 9-pixel (R2 = 0.90) temperatures. These findings demonstrate the algorithm to be a suitable method of analysing the eye and cheek regions from thermal infrared images. Validated as a suitable method for automatically detecting and analysing the eye and cheek regions from thermal infrared images, the integration of IRT into automated on-farm systems has the potential to be implemented as an automated method of monitoring calf health and welfare. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart farming is a new concept that makes agriculture more efficient and effective by using advanced information technologies. The latest advancements in connectivity, automation, and artificial intelligence enable farmers better to monitor all procedures and apply precise treatments determined by machines with superhuman accuracy. Farmers, data scientists and, engineers continue to work on techniques that allow optimizing the human labor required in farming. With valuable information resources improving day by day, smart farming turns into a learning system and becomes even smarter. Deep learning is a type of machine learning method, using artificial neural network principles. The main feature by which deep learning networks are distinguished from neural networks is their depth and that feature makes them capable of discovering latent structures within unlabeled, unstructured data. Deep learning networks that do not need human intervention while performing automatic feature extraction have a significant advantage over previous algorithms. The focus of this study is to explore the advantages of using deep learning in agricultural applications.

	abstract = {Around the world, governments are implementing services combined with artificial intelligence to improve service to the population. The main objective of this study is to develop a chatbot prototype able to answer the most frequently asked questions about the Plant Health department of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply (MAPA), reducing the workload dedicated to responding emails and phone calls, in addition to providing face-to-face care. Initially, investigations were made on the concepts of artificial intelligence, the different types of chatbots and the tools needed to build the prototype. Subsequently, an analysis of the chosen tool and programming language was elaborated. After that, the development of the application and the configuration of the platforms began. Considering how a chatbot can spread information, including good practices about plant health and agriculture, this project can contribute to food security, increasing productivity and fighting against waste, helping to achieve UN SDG number 2-zero hunger.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Diseases of the respiratory system are known to negatively impact the profitability of the pig industry, worldwide. Considering the relatively short lifespan of pigs, lesions can be still evident at slaughter, where they can be usefully recorded and scored. Therefore, the slaughterhouse represents a key check-point to assess the health status of pigs, providing unique and valuable feedback to the farm, as well as an important source of data for epidemiological studies. Although relevant, scoring lesions in slaughtered pigs represents a very time-consuming and costly activity, thus making difficult their systematic recording. The present study has been carried out to train a convolutional neural network-based system to automatically score pleurisy in slaughtered pigs. The automation of such a process would be extremely helpful to enable a systematic examination of all slaughtered livestock. Overall, our data indicate that the proposed system is well able to differentiate half carcasses affected with pleurisy from healthy ones, with an overall accuracy of 85.5%. The system was better able to recognize severely affected half carcasses as compared with those showing less severe lesions. The training of convolutional neural networks to identify and score pneumonia, on the one hand, and the achievement of trials in large capacity slaughterhouses, on the other, represent the natural pursuance of the present study. As a result, convolutional neural network-based technologies could provide a fast and cheap tool to systematically record lesions in slaughtered pigs, thus supplying an enormous amount of useful data to all stakeholders in the pig industry. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Larvae of Hermetia illucens, also commonly known as black soldier fly (BSF) have gained significant importance in the feed industry, primarily used as feed for aquaculture and other livestock farming. Mathematical models such as the Von Bertalanffy growth model and dynamic energy budget models are available for modelling the growth of various organisms but have their demerits for their application to the growth and development of BSF. Also, such dynamic models were not yet applied to the growth of the BSF larvae despite models proven to be useful for automation of industrial production process (e.g. feeding, heating/ cooling, ventilation, harvesting, etc.). This work primarily focuses on developing a model based on the principles of the afore mentioned models from literature that can provide accurate mathematical description of the dry mass changes throughout the life cycle and the transition of development phases of the larvae. To further improve the accuracy of these models, various factors affecting the growth and development such as temperature, feed quality, feeding rate, moisture content in feed, and airflow rate are developed and integrated into the dynamic growth model. An extensive set of data was aggregated from various literature and used for the model development, parameter estimation and validation. Models describing the environmental factors were individually validated based on the data sets collected. In addition, the dynamic growth model was also validated for dry mass evolution and development stage transition of larvae reared on different substrate feeding rates. The developed models with the estimated parameters performed well, highlighting their potential application in decision-support systems and automation for large scale production. © 2020 Padmanabha et al.

	abstract = {New ideas for diagnostics in clinical parasitology are needed to overcome some of the difficulties experienced in the widespread adoption of detection methods for gastrointestinal parasites in livestock. Here we provide an initial evaluation of the performance of a newly developed automated device (Telenostic) to identify and quantify parasitic elements in fecal samples. This study compared the Telenostic device with the McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC for counting of strongyle eggs in a fecal sample. Three bovine fecal samples were examined, in triplicate, on each of the three fecal egg-counting devices. In addition, both manual (laboratory technician) and automated analysis (image analysis algorithm) were performed on the Telenostic device to calculate fecal egg counts (FEC). Overall, there were consistent egg counts reported across the three devices and calculation methods. The Telenostic device compared very favourably to the Mini-FLOTAC and McMaster. Only in sample C, a significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed between the egg counts obtained by Mini-FLOTAC and by the other methods. From this limited dataset it can be concluded that the Telenostic-automated test is comparable to currently used benchmark FEC methods, while improving the workflow, test turn-around time and not requiring trained laboratory personnel to operate or interpret the results.

	abstract = {As the world's population increases, demand for poultry products will continue to increase. To meet this demand, one candidate mechanism to increase production is to increase housing and manage more birds. However, this practice, along with labour shortages and increasing biosecurity practices will make it increasingly difficult for producers to monitor the production, health, and welfare status of all their birds. Employing smart poultry management systems is necessary to increase production while minimizing costs and the use of resources. Smart poultry management systems include precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies such as smart sensors, automation of farm processes, and data driven decision making platforms. Many new technologies will have great implications for poultry production in the areas of the poultry house environment, bird welfare, precision feeding, and rapid detection of infectious disease. As smart sensors collect data in real-time on a variety of parameters from poultry operations, large amounts of data will be generated. To make best use of this data, big data analytical tools must be employed to produce data driven decisions. Additionally, the devices that will be incorporated into smart poultry management systems will be connected to the Internet allowing for the formation of Internet of things (IoT) farm networks. IoT technologies allow for communication between farm sensors, devices, and equipment, and will lead to the automation of multiple farm procedures. The following review discusses the areas of impact that new smart sensor technologies will have on poultry operations and describes how sensor technology is related to big data analytics and IoT systems, and how these technologies can enhance production in the poultry industry. Additionally, challenges to the described systems and technologies will also be highlighted and discussed. © 2020},

	abstract = {The challenge of getting machines to understand and interact with natural objects is encountered in important areas such as medicine, agriculture, and, in our case, slaughterhouse automation. Recent breakthroughs have enabled the application of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) directly to point clouds, an efficient and natural representation of 3D objects. The potential of these methods has mostly been demonstrated for classification and segmentation tasks involving rigid man-made objects. We present a method, based on the successful PointNet architecture, for learning to regress correct tool placement from human demonstrations, using virtual reality. Our method is applied to a challenging slaughterhouse cutting task, which requires an understanding of the local geometry including the shape, size, and orientation. We propose an intermediate five-Degree of Freedom (DoF) cutting plane representation, a point and a normal vector, which eases the demonstration and learning process. A live experiment is conducted in order to unveil issues and begin to understand the required accuracy. Eleven cuts are rated by an expert, with 8/11 being rated as acceptable. The error on the test set is subsequently reduced through the addition of more training data and improvements to the DNN. The result is a reduction in the average translation from 1.5 cm to 0.8 cm and the orientation error from 4.59◦ to 4.48◦. The method’s generalization capacity is assessed on a similar task from the slaughterhouse and on the very different public LINEMOD dataset for object pose estimation across view points. In both cases, the method shows promising results. Code, datasets, and Supplementary Materials are available at https://github.com/markpp/PoseFromPointClouds. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Achieving long term autonomy of robots operating in dynamic environments such as farms remains a significant challenge. Arguably, the most demanding factors to achieve this are the on-board resource constraints such as energy, planning in the presence of moving individuals such as livestock and people, and handling unknown and undulating terrain. These considerations require a robot to be adaptive in its immediate actions in order to successfully achieve long-term, resource-efficient and robust autonomy. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates a local dynamic path planner with a longer term objective based planner and advanced motion control methods, whilst taking into consideration the dynamic responses of moving individuals within the environment. The framework is motivated by and synthesizes our recent work on energy aware mission planning, path planning in dynamic environments, and receding horizon motion control. In this paper we detail the proposed framework and outline its integration on a robotic platform. We evaluate the strategy in extensive simulated trials, traversing between objective waypoints to complete tasks such as soil sampling, weeding and recharging across a dynamic environment, demonstrating its capability to robustly adapt long term mission plans in the presence of moving individuals and obstacles for real world applications such as large scale farming. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This project aimed to evaluate a novel method for monitoring the health of grazing cattle. The method studied in this paper is based on an unmanned, automatic precision weighing system that can be used on pasture, and which will alarm farmers when animals show abnormal weight gain curves. The project focused primarily on the detection of pasture-borne nematode parasite infections, which clearly reduce the weight gain of calves, but the method could be further developed to include other diseases that impair animal performance. The early detection of nematode infections would both improve animal welfare and minimize the use of anthelmintics. This study included a total of 63 first season grazing steers born from dairy cows that were allocated to one of two permanent semi-natural pasture enclosures for 20 weeks. Both enclosures had two identical scales except that one scale was powered with line current and one scale was equipped with solar panels. The automatic weighing stations were situated in close proximity to a source of water, salt and minerals so that animals would voluntarily pass through them on a regular basis. LiveStock PlannerⓇ software was used to identify usable data. The number of usable recordings per animal throughout the grazing season varied from 547 to 2677 amongst the four weighing stations, with an average of five usable recordings per animal obtained each week. The herds were guided to the weighing area on a daily basis during the first eight weeks of the grazing period to ensure that the steers received enough water. After this period, manual observations were used to verify that all animals entered the watering area without problems. The findings showed that the weighing technique worked well; hence, the developed method demonstrates great potential as an automatic supervision tool for grazing cattle. However, even though the summer of 2016 was quite dry, there was still water available in ditches and puddles. Accordingly, water alone was not a strong enough motivation to get cattle to pass through the weighing station into the watering area. Hence, in grazing areas with natural water sources, a reward more attractive than the water, salt and minerals used in this study is needed to ensure frequent voluntary passage of cattle through the scales. © 2020},

	abstract = {Individual cattle identification plays an important role for automation in precision livestock management. Existing methods for cattle identification require radio frequency and visual ear tags, all of which are prone to loss or damage. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based framework to identify beef cattle using image sequences, unifying merits of both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network methods. A CNN (Inception-V3) was used to extract features from a video dataset taken of the rear-view of cattle, after which extracted features were fed to a BiLSTM layer to capture spatial-temporal information enabling the identification of each individual animal. A total of 363 rear-view videos of 50 cattle were collected for our dataset. The proposed method achieved 91% identification accuracy using a 30-frame video length, improving that of Inception-V3 use or LSTM. Additionally, increasing video sequence length to 30-frames enhanced identification performance. Our approach can use spatial-temporal features to identify cattle, and enables automated identification for precision livestock farming. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Schedonorus arundinaceus (tall fescue) population can be infected by the endophyte fungus Epichloë coenophiala, responsible of livestock intoxication due to fungal alkaloids (i.e., ergovaline). The effects of ergovaline in pastures can be aenuated through dilution; this is, to interseed infected tall fescue (E+) with legumes, endophyte-free grass, or with both. Plant interaction and ergovaline concentration in mixture of tall fescue (E+) and Lotus tenuis, a forage legume, were investigated in replacement series experiments under defoliation conditions. The interaction between species was analysed through relative yield total (RYT) of the forage biomass, aggressivity index (AI), plant cover and ergovaline concentration. The work was performed in field conditions. Six cuttings were applied during the experimental period. Plant monocultures of each species were at a constant density of 80 pl/m2, while mixtures ratios were 20:60, 40:40 and 60:20 pl/m2 of L. tenuis and tall fescue, respectively. Mortality of L. tenuis and tall fescue plants was not observed. Tall fescues yield and plant cover, in monoculture and in mixture, were higher than in L. tenuis. RYT was higher than 1 for all mixtures. According to AI, in mixture, tall fescue was the dominant species and overcompensated the lower yield of L. tenuis. At the early Autumn, ergovaline concentration in monoculture was 1.637±0.594 ng/g, and in the 40:40 mixture was 0.407±0.109 ng/g. Forage production was higher in mixtures than in monocultures, and L. tenuis contributed to reduce ergovaline concentration. According to the results, 40:40 pl/m2 of tall fescue and L. tenuis was the best species combination. A positive effect of L. tenuis on growth of tall fescue mediated by nitrogen availability could have allowed the plant coexistence. Future experiments should analyse the variation of alkaloid concentration and forage production in tall fescue pastures, according to L. tenuis proportion, defoliation frequency and intensity under different seasons. © 2020, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

Within Australia, sheep meat consumption continues to rise, with beef consumption being amongst the highest in the world; therefore, efficient strategies to increase herd/flock size are integral to the success of these industries. Reproductive management is crucial to increasing the efficiency of Australian breeding programs. The use of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) has the potential to increase efficiency significantly. The implementation of multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) and juvenile in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (JIVET) in combination with genomic selection and natural mating and AI is the most efficient way to increase genetic gain, and thus increase reproductive efficiency within the Australian livestock industries. However, ARTs are costly, and high variation, particularly between embryo transfer recipients in their ability to maintain pregnancy, is a significant constraint to the widespread commercial adoption of ARTs. The use of a phenotypic marker for the selection of recipients, as well as the better management of recipient animals, may be an efficient and cost-effective means to increase the productivity of the Australian livestock industry. © 2020 by the authors.

Works in this direction are based primarily on a detailed study of the properties of various objects of agricultural production, as the basis for the analysis and synthesis of effective automatic control systems is mathematical modeling of real processes and devices. Recently, there has been a transition from the modeling of individual devices to the modeling of complex technological schemes, which is largely due to a significant increase in the complexity and dimension of the problems to be solved. Therefore, this approach allows you to set and solve optimal control problems not only for individual devices, but for entire technological complexes, which in turn will provide a significant economic effect and will be widely used in solving many engineering problems. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.},

Despite its economic and welfare implications, there is a lack of objective indicator traits and limited incorporation of temperament in dairy cattle breeding programs. The increased intensifcation of dairy production systems, including the adoption of robotic milking machines and automatic feeders, is contributing to a growing interest to selectively breed for improved temperament and milking effciency. The main challenges for wider incorporation of temperament in dairy breeding programs are the defnition of indicator traits, large-scale phenotyping, lack of understanding of the genetic background of the traits, and availability of the economic values of temperament. Genomics combined with high-throughput phenotyping will be essential to optimize selection for improved temperament traits in dairy cattle.

	abstract = {Farmers spend a lot on conventional pumping methods to provide fresh water to their livestock. This paper deals with the design of an automatic pumping system for pastoral farming in rural areas. To replace the current conventional methods, this system is powered with PV panels which reduces cost because of saving on cost of electricity. Most pumps must be manually controlled hence the objective is to supply the water to the designated location via automatically controlled system without human interventions by implementing a suitable automation method. This is achieved by simulations through Microcontroller ATMEGA16 type programmed in embedded C programming language. This system involves solar modules and water level sensors. These sensors are located inside the water tank to detect the amount of water and then inform the farmer. Thus, from a remote location, the farmer can communicate with the pump for water level control in the tank via GSM module. If the water level reaches a level below the predetermined level, the pump should pump in water without farmer's notification to prevent motor run dry problems and so that water requirements are met. Consequently, reduction in environmental impacts as solar energy is clean and efficient, and thus it leads to effective use of water and electricity. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Individual animal identification is an essential part of the large-scale, informatized, and refined development of animal husbandry, because it can trace the milk source and meat products of each cow, and it can also promote the smooth development of beef cattle insurance policies. Deep learning technologies are used to help identify individual livestock. These technologies can help staff avoid too intensive labor and time-consuming, worry-free and accurate identification of animals. This research proposes a robust deep learning method to classify 5 Holstein cows in the same cowshed. In order to prove this concept, the 48-hour activity data of 5 cows collected by a collar equipped with an activity collector were combined to create a data set. After feature extraction of the data, a deep neural network model based on the Keras framework was selected. The best result of the deep neural network reached 93.81% precision, 93.49% recall and 93.45% F1-score. The results show that the method has high precision, recall and F1 score, and can classify and identify different cows. © 2020 ACM.},

Cryopreservation provides long-term preservation of sperm and also encourages a greater exchange of genetic material between distant populations. However, freezing has some detrimental effects on sperm, including premature induction of acrosome response, reduced sperm motility, reduced viability, and impaired sperm DNA integrity and fertility. The transition of the membrane phase occurs when the sperm cools down, and lipid accumulation damages the micro-domain, thereby impairing membrane functions, leaving a gap between the gel and the liquid membrane region. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a vital lipophilic molecule found in all respiratory eukaryotic cells, including spermatozoa. When such a lipophilic antioxidant is added to the sperm, it can directly diffuse into the polyunsaturated lipid chain present in the plasma membrane, thereby affecting the structure and function of the sperm by generating energy and preventing reactive oxygen. Coenzyme Q10 treatment of sperm from various species improves sperm quality during cryopreservation and cooled-stored condition. It is, however, unclear how this antioxidant affects sperm to improve survival during freezing or cooled-stored condition. Thus, this review highlights the potential protective mechanisms of coenzyme Q10 action during the sperm freezing process.},

	abstract = {The advent of agricultural robotics research worldwide has brought substantial improvement for various applications. This article provides a comprehensive review of published research and development work, emphasizing robotics enabling machine capabilities. These machine capabilities of perception, reasoning and learning, communication, task planning and execution, and systems integration have opened possibilities for intelligent automation of current and future agricultural operations, including precision livestock farming. We have focused on the Agricultural Intelligent Automation Systems which have a high potential to be applied to agricultural production and processing, especially with applicability to poultry production. Most of the published work on agricultural robotics has been in the areas of perception and reasoning. The emphases have been in the identification of objects, evaluation of product quality, monitoring of plant and animal growth and development, yield prediction, and machine guidance. There has been limited published work on the task execution and systems integration aspects of agricultural robotics. Moreover, we have reviewed agricultural robotics research from 24 universities worldwide. Agricultural robots can be divided into three categories (monitor, harvester, and both) according to various functions. Several tables are presented to summarize the information on the key subject areas reviewed in this article. We have found that there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in robotizing agricultural tasks in general and in poultry production specifically. The most common challenges in robotics applications have been developing robots for specific agricultural tasks. Examples in poultry production include monitoring environmental conditions and chicken health, egg picking, and encouraging chicken movement. The approaches to addressing the technical needs have been creating intelligent movable machines for use alongside the chickens in poultry house. The most noticeable results include Octopus Poultry Safe (OPS) robot for sanitizing poultry houses autonomously, PoultryBot for picking floor eggs, and Spoutnic for training hens to move. This trend of research and development is expected to continue. An emerging research emphasis is systems approach to study the interactions of automated tasks to achieve high efficiency in whole poultry house management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Computer Vision, Digital Image Processing, and Digital Image Analysis can be viewed as an amalgam of terms that very often are used to describe similar processes. Most of this confusion arises because these are interconnected fields that emerged with the development of digital image acquisition. Thus, there is a need to understand the connection between these fields, how a digital image is formed, and the differences regarding the many sensors available, each best suited for different applications. From the advent of the charge-coupled devices demarking the birth of digital imaging, the field has advanced quite fast. Sensors have evolved from grayscale to color with increasingly higher resolution and better performance. Also, many other sensors have appeared, such as infrared cameras, stereo imaging, time of flight sensors, satellite, and hyperspectral imaging. There are also images generated by other signals, such as sound (ultrasound scanners and sonars) and radiation (standard x-ray and computed tomography), which are widely used to produce medical images. In animal and veterinary sciences, these sensors have been used in many applications, mostly under experimental conditions and with just some applications yet developed on commercial farms. Such applications can range from the assessment of beef cuts composition to live animal identification, tracking, behavior monitoring, and measurement of phenotypes of interest, such as body weight, condition score, and gait. Computer vision systems (CVS) have the potential to be used in precision livestock farming and high-throughput phenotyping applications. We believe that the constant measurement of traits through CVS can reduce management costs and optimize decision-making in livestock operations, in addition to opening new possibilities in selective breeding. Applications of CSV are currently a growing research area and there are already commercial products available. However, there are still challenges that demand research for the successful development of autonomous solutions capable of delivering critical information. This review intends to present significant developments that have been made in CVS applications in animal and veterinary sciences and to highlight areas in which further research is still needed before full deployment of CVS in breeding programs and commercial farms. © Copyright © 2020 Fernandes, Dórea and Rosa.},

	abstract = {Natural and anthropogenic determinants of riverine phosphorus (P) pollution strongly vary with different ecological and socio-economic conditions and represent a substantial challenge to aquatic environment protection and ecological restoration in agricultural catchments. Riverine water flux and total P (TP) and dissolved P (DP) concentrations were observed, and major catchment geometric, landscape and anthropogenic characteristics were investigated in one forest and ten agricultural catchments in subtropical China during 2011–2017 to identify the key determinants of the catchment riverine P levels and loadings and to develop prediction functions for these P levels and loadings. The results suggested that 39% of the collected stream water samples were determined to have TP pollution, indicating moderate riverine P pollution in the catchments. The catchment riverine P levels illustrated an increasing P trend during 2011–2016 but a decreasing P trend in 2017 through the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter analysis, and the decreasing trend was mainly caused by reduced catchment livestock density. Landscape configuration (cohesion index (COHESION), aggregation index (AI), mean shape index (SHMN), and patch density (PD)) and anthropogenic activities (livestock density) were identified as the major determinants of riverine P concentrations and loadings through partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis, of which cohesion index and livestock density were the only two variables that had a variable importance for the projection (VIP) value greater than 1.0; this result confirmed the substantial effects of these variables on riverine P. The multiple linear regression prediction functions showed generally acceptable performances (R2 ≥ 0.40) for riverine P but relatively poor performance in predicting P loadings (R2 = 0.40–0.46) in comparison to predicting P concentrations (R2 = 0.51–0.54), probably due to the variations in the hydrological process in subtropical China. Therefore, the results provide useful information for identifying the natural and anthropogenic determinants of riverine P to control this type of P in subtropical agricultural catchments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To maintain the physical condition of sows frequent observations are necessary. Lameness is a common concern in group-housed systems. However, current methods are done manually by subjective methods, thus are difficult to complete. One alternative would be to automate the process by analyzing images generated by depth cameras. The present work aimed to develop and test a method for early detection of lameness in sows, adapting the kinematics method using top down depth cameras without the aid of reflective markers. Depth images were processed by dividing the animals into five body regions: head, left and right shoulders, and left and right hips. The centroid of each position was calculated, and their heights were recorded. Average, maximum, and minimum height at each of the five regions was calculated. The animal's velocity was also measured by calculating the Euclidian distance between positions of the animals' body centroid (not considering its head) over the time between frames. The curves of height by time obtained for the centroids of all five regions were plotted and analyzed. Time and length for each step was also computed. Preliminary results indicate lameness level was best correlated with number, time, and length of steps for each of four regions (left and right shoulders and left and right hips); total walk time; and number of local maxima for the head region. With the automation of lameness detection, it could be possible to have better insights on the physical condition of sows and aid on better and faster management decisions. © ASABE 2020 Annual International Meeting.},

We adapted the questionnaire proposed by APO (Knowledge management: facilitators guide. Tokyo; 2009), to evaluate the KM in the Brazilian agribusiness sector, delimiting four main dimensions: Leadership, People, Processes, and Technology. The questionnaire was validated with 11 experts, and we performed a pretest with 5 from poultry farms. The data were collected from 240 managers from poultry farms. The results reveal that KM practices are known to livestock sector managers of the Brazilian poultry industry, but are implemented in isolation, either without leadership, strategic management or with neither of the two. The People dimension presented the lowest KM average and shows a dependency on external technical assistance. The dimension Process has the highest KM average, confirming previous work about the agility, quality, and innovative capacity of the Brazilian poultry sector. The results indicate that, in order to introduce smart factoring, Brazilian agribusiness need more investment in farmer’s schooling, partnerships to share knowledge with stakeholders, and the introduction of new technologies based on KM practices. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The purpose of food processing has changed over time. High‐intensity industrially processed food often exhibits higher concentrations of added sugar, salt, higher energy, and lower micronutrient density than does similar food or meals prepared at home from raw or minimally processed food. Viewing the evolution of food processing from history, one could make out three major transitions related to human socioeconomic changes. The first transition was marked by the change from hunting and gathering to settled societies with agriculture and livestock farming. The second and third transitions were associated with the Industrial Revolution and with market liberalization, global trade and automation, respectively. The next major transition that will influence food processing and shape human nutrition may include the exploitation of sustainable and efficient protein and food sources that will ensure high‐quality food production for the growing world population. Apart from novel food sources, traditional food such as legumes and pulses likewise exhibit great potential to contribute to a healthy balanced diet. The promotion of legumes should be intensified in public dietary guidelines because their consumption is rather low in high-income countries and increasingly displaced as a traditional staple by industrially processed food in low‐ to middle‐income countries. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Present study aimed meat production augmented with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), essential fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) by supplementation of linseed and Ca-soap in weaner lamb diets. Thirty-six, 3 month old Malpura lambs were randomly divided into three dietary treatments comprising of Control, linseed (10 % crushed linseed) and Ca-soap (5 % Ca-soap), fed for 90 days and slaughtered at 6 months of age to determine chemical composition and fatty acid profile of carcass. All the lambs received a basal diet of ad lib. pala (Ziziphus numularia) leaves and respective concentrate mixtures formulated as per the dietary treatments. Hot carcass weight (kg), total fat (%), cooking loss (%) and water holding capacity (%) remained similar (P > 0.05) among the treatment groups. Feeding of Ca-soap reduced (P < 0.05) total saturated fatty acid (SFA) and enhanced (P < 0.05) total monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content in longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle fat than linseed and control groups. Moreover, the ratio of n-6/n-3 values was lower (P < 0.05) in both Ca-soap and linseed group than control but the atherogenic index (AI) was lower only in Ca-soap group. The amount of C18:2 c9 t11 CLA in LT muscle was highest (P < 0.05) in linseed group followed by Ca-soap and control group. Likewise, in adipose tissue the proportion of PUFA, n-3 fatty acids was higher (P < 0.05) in linseed group whereas, MUFA and TI (thrombogenic index) was increased (P < 0.05) in Ca-soap fed group. Similarly, the proportion of C18:2 c9t11 CLA in adipose tissue showed similar trend like LT muscle and highest (P < 0.05) value was observed in linseed fed lambs. These findings indicate that inclusion of Ca-soap and linseed in the diet of finisher lambs resulted in enhanced content of desirable fatty acids in both LT muscle and adipose tissue. Therefore, adding Ca-soap and crushed linseed in diets can be a promising option for modifying fatty acid make-up of finisher lambs and provide better nutritional quality meat to consumers. © 2020},

Since the LoRa LPWAN (LoRaWAN) medium access control (MAC) layer does not provide a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism, we propose a custom MAC layer with LBT-based carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). The devised system has been implemented using off-the-shelf hardware, and its performance has also been estimated with the help of a C++ event-based simulator.

Even though there is a consensus on the utility of such tools, rangeland assessment with high detail (grain) while covering large areas or landscapes (extension) is too costly. Then, the compatibility between the resolution and quality of information and the spatial extent required to make decisions in livestock systems is still an operational challenge that has not found an effective solution. Thus, the use of satellite images for rangeland assessments in different environments has been growing steadily in the last two decades. The developments associated with the capture of images using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would offer many advantages as a complement to information, since they increase the spatial resolution. The aim of this work was to classify rangeland environments using satellite and UAV images and compare their respective contributions for rangeland assessments in Patagonia. In particular, spatial resolution of an unsupervised classification of rangeland environments using SPOT 7 satellite images and images captured by an optical sensor mounted on an UAV were compared. Rangeland assessment can be potentiated by the use of different sources of information in a more complementary and accessible way for environmental monitoring, and for a pastoral management planning in highly heterogeneous environments from arid and semiarid regions of Patagonia, Argentina. © 2019, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

This issue is of growing interest in precision livestock farming, which is largely based on the development of data acquisition automation and on the development of interpretative tools to capitalize on high throughput raw data and to generate benchmarks for phenotypic traits. The method that we propose in the paper falls in this context. Our methodology relies on a piecewise linear estimation of curves based on a novel regularized change-point-estimation method and on the k-means algorithm applied to a vector of coefficients summarizing the curves. The statistical performance of our method is assessed through numerical experiments and is thoroughly compared with existing experiments. Our technique is finally applied to milk emission kinetics data with the aim of a better characterization of interanimal variability and towards a better understanding of the lactation process. © 2020 Royal Statistical Society},

	abstract = {An incursion of an important exotic transboundary animal disease requires a prompt and intensive response. The routine analysis of up-to-date data, as near to real time as possible, is essential for the objective assessment of the patterns of disease spread or effectiveness of control measures and the formulation of alternative control strategies. In this paper, we describe the Standard Analysis of Disease Investigation (SADI), a toolbox for informing disease outbreak response, which was developed as part of New Zealand's biosecurity preparedness. SADI was generically designed on a web-based software platform, Integrated Real-time Information System (IRIS). We demonstrated the use of SADI for a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak scenario in New Zealand. The data standards were set within SADI, accommodating a single relational database that integrated the national livestock population data, outbreak data, and tracing data. We collected a well-researched, standardised set of 16 epidemiologically relevant analyses for informing the FMD outbreak response, including farm response timelines, interactive outbreak/network maps, stratified epidemic curves, estimated dissemination rates, estimated reproduction numbers, and areal attack rates. The analyses were programmed within SADI to automate the process to generate the reports at a regular interval (daily) using the most up-to-date data. Having SADI prepared in advance and the process streamlined for data collection, analysis and reporting would free a wider group of epidemiologists during an actual disease outbreak from solving data inconsistency among response teams, daily “number crunching,” or providing largely retrospective analyses. Instead, the focus could be directed into enhancing data collection strategies, improving data quality, understanding the limitations of the data available, interpreting the set of analyses, and communicating their meaning with response teams, decision makers and public in the context of the epidemic. © Copyright © 2020 Bingham, Wada, van Andel, McFadden, Sanson and Stevenson.},

This study explored farmers' perceptions of the feasibility and practicality of exoskeleton use in Canadian prairie grain and livestock farm operations. Fifteen farm workers (age 25–70 years) used a passive back-supporting exoskeleton during standardized and unique tasks at their own farms. They then participated in semi-structured interviews regarding their experiences during the trials, advantages and disadvantages of exoskeleton use, suggested improvements, and speculation about feasibility of exoskeleton use on farms. Interview analysis revealed seven overlapping and inter-related themes: ‘safety’, ‘comfort’, ‘jobs & timing’, ‘health’, ‘mobility’, ‘ease of use’, and ‘productivity’. Interviews showed diversity in farmers' perceptions of exoskeleton performance within these themes, demonstrating that successful implementation on farms will require alignment between the exoskeleton design, the users, and the tasks being performed. Findings can facilitate development of future designs as well as appropriate implementation strategies for the farm environment, with the ultimate goal of improving the health, quality of life, and productivity of farmers and workers facing similar ergonomic hazards. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The emergence of smart agriculture (Internet of things in agriculture) will facilitate taking decision for owners and responsible persons. Decision making is also facilitated by the quality interface of the information system, which includes the characteristics of data from all types of devices. An additional factor complicating making decision is the ambiguity of the data, which in turn leads to some conflicts. A Petri nets-based model can be used to model and analyse risks.

	abstract = {Intelligent agriculture has the potential of increasing sustainability and productivity in the field of agriculture and livestock, through efficient and precise use of resources. Thus, this technology gives the possibility of promoting growth in developing countries through automation and control of repetitive farming activities, such as monitoring the level of water and feed in the feeders, which allows farmers to save time. However, the implementation of an automatic feed and water level control system in a livestock enclosure requires a large investment in silo scales, which may be too expensive for an SME. Thanks to the evolution of IoT devices, it is possible to reduce the cost of this implementation while integrating new functionalities and interactions through the interconnection of devices with cloud solutions. This work presents a new system that allows to monitor the quantity and quality of food and water in a silo by estimating volume in real time. Moreover, it has an additional functionality; temperature and humidity estimation in a livestock enclosure. The hardware system will be managed by a multi-agent system in charge of the processes of managing the data, managing the quantity of food and water supplied to each feeder. The use of a multi-agent architecture allows for the development of a distributed solution that provides great possibilities for future analysis, for example through a massive data analysis. The case study results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, it has provided the ideal amount of feed and water to the animals, controlling the quality of grain and water, reducing the number of colics caused by overfeeding. In addition, the time the farmer must spend on the farm reduces considerably. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

In the process of breading flocks and herds, the feed cost can be reduced largely by utilizing king grass rationally. King grass needs to be cut and ground for being used as feedingstuff. Conventional manual process consumes a large quantity of manpower and material resources, leads to the reduction of production efficiency, and brings about high labor intensity. In view of this, an automatic control king grass crusher high efficiency and practicability is designed, which integrates cutting and crushing. This machine is based on SCM, which realizes whole-process automatic control and rational coordination of pressure sensor with stepping motor for various movements, and can handle king grass crushing well. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {India is the house of the largest livestock population as well as highest milk producing country of the world. But, productivity of the large ruminant, i.e. cattle and buffalo is far below the world standard. Hence, the delivery of livestock extension services is emerging as an important priority area for enhancing and optimizing livestock production and productivity. At present livestock farming in India is at transition phase, i.e. transforming from subsistence to a commercial venture. Therefore, 100 livestock farmers and 60 commercial livestock farmers were randomly selected from the two highly crossbred populated districts of eastern Haryana to understand their demand for livestock extension services particularly livestock extension services other than the routine one. Incomplete Order of Merit Rating as Suggested by Garret was used to assess the degree of importance of the identified demand driven livestock extension services. A total 26 livestock extension services were demanded by the farmers of the eastern Haryana amongst which three services for specialized breeding services, 5 for animal feeding purposes, 7 for livestock production and management 6 for healthcare related and 5 services towards marketing and extension services. Both types of the farmers had a highest demand for conventional livestock extension services like timely AI services, vaccination services and non-conventional extension service like demonstration-cum-training programme on Azolla production and conservation. Livestock farmers were highly interested to grow as an entrepreneur, whereas, commercial livestock farmers were highly interested to strengthen their farm by securing credit accessibility. Hence, Livestock farmers' need on specialized demand driven extension services has been identified along with their degree of importance which may help in policy formulation in future for re-institutionalized public livestock extension services. © 2020 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

The main objective is to deploy a limited number of drones to track and monitor the maximum number of livestock, such as cattle and sheep, in a vast pasture while minimizing the average drone-animal distance. We assume the targeted livestock have been fitted with GPS collars, and the mobility of each animal cannot be neglected. We first introduce a procedure of performing sweep coverage by drones. By deploying drones to accomplish sweep coverage for the entire pasture, the initial locations of all targeted animals can be acquired. Then we applied a density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN to find the deployment that places the drones to the centroids of animal clusters. Furthermore, based on the updated animals' locations, the deployment of the drones can be updated to follow the movement of animal clusters. We demonstrate that our solution can always yield a lower average drone-animal distance and a higher number of covered targeted animals, compared with the standard K-Means clustering algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.},

It can detect any changes before the appearance of the clinical signs, allowing the farmer to take necessary measures as soon as possible. The objective of this study is to develop an effective un-supervised classification model of data collected by Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) attached to the back of dairy cows housed in free-stall. These data were aggregated according to different sampling frequencies and segmentation windows. The different times of lying, standing, lying down, standing up, walking and stationary behaviors were observed and recorded in real time. The designed classification model is based on univariate and multivariate Finite Mixture Models (FMM) and decision trees. The valid transitions between standing and lying behaviors are guaranteed by constraints imposed by a deterministic finite state automaton. The obtained results revealed that 99% of behaviors are well classified. Standing, lying on each side and changing between these positions are classified with 100% accuracy, followed by stationary with 99% sensitivity, 96% specificity, 99% precision and 99% accuracy. The walking behavior is classified with 96% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 91% precision and 98% accuracy. These results show that the back is an interesting location for sensors to monitor the dairy cow behavior. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {World experience shows that family farms are the basis for the agricultural sector of countries with advanced market economies. The analysis of the components of the livestock ration provided an opportunity to identify the amount of feed mixture, which needs to be distributed to animals per day, depending on the livestock. Researches have shown that for preparation and distribution of feed on farms with livestock up to 10 cattles, it is advisable to use inefficient machinery with energy drive and partial execution of manual operations, 11-35 - self-feeders, mechanized lines using stationary machinery with energy drive and forklifts. For 36-50 cattles of livestock and at an average animal productivity of at least 6500 kg of milk per year, processes of preparation and distribution of feed can provide self-feeding and mobile combined feed making machines. Preparation and distribution of feed mixes for 51-400 heads of cattle - provide mobile combined feed making machines with delivery of the mixture on the feed tables. For livestock with more than 400 heads of cattles, it is advisable to use stationary robotic feed making facilities and distributors of feed mixtures or a mobile combined feed making machine. In the feed mixture preparation process, it was found that the multifunctional feed making machines with a vertically positioned conical auger in the hopper have a high power consumption of more than 35 kW. Power consumption, driven by the working bodies, is almost directly proportional to the speed of an auger. With increasing rotation frequency of an auger, the efficiency of grinding and mixing does not increase significantly; we have substantiated the rotation frequency of an auger 16-20 min-1, with grinding rolls and packs and in the mode of mixing and dispensing 24-25 min-1. However, in the process of dispensing the feed mixture, the existing auger does not clean itself from the feed. © 2020 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. All rights reserved.},

Objectives: This study measured the concentration of the disinfectant to determine why it failed to remove the horizontal transmission despite increased disinfectant use. Methods: Surveys were conducted from February to May 2017, collecting 348 samples from disinfection systems. The samples were analyzed using the Standards of Animal Health Products analysis methods from QIA. Results: Twenty-three facilities used inappropriate or non-approved disinfectants. Nearly all sampled livestock farms and facilities-93.9%-did not properly adjust the disinfectant concentration. The percentage using low concentrations, or where no effective substance was detected, was 46.9%. Furthermore, 13 samples from the official disinfection station did not use effective disinfectant, and-among 72 samples from the disinfection station-88.89% were considered inappropriate concentration, according to the foot-and-mouth disease virus guidelines; considering the AIV guideline, 73.61% were inappropriate concentrations. Inappropriate concentration samples on automatic (90.00%) and semi-automatic (90.90%) disinfection systems showed no significant difference from manual methods (88.24%). Despite this study being conducted during the crisis level, most disinfectants were used inappropriately. Conclusions: This may partially explain why horizontal transmission of FMD and AI cannot be effectively prevented despite extensive disinfectant use. © 2020 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science.},

	abstract = {Disease outbreaks in U.S. animal livestock industries have economic impacts measured in hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Biosecurity, or procedures intended to protect animals against disease, is known to be effective at reducing infection risk at facilities. Yet, to the detriment of animal health, humans do not always follow biosecurity protocols. Human behavioral factors have been shown to influence willingness to follow biosecurity protocols. Here we show how social cues may affect cooperation with a biosecurity practice. Participants were immersed in a simulated swine production facility through a graphical user interface and prompted to make a decision that addressed their willingness to comply with a biosecurity practice. We tested the effect of varying three experimental variables: (1) the risk of acquiring an infection, (2) the delivery method of the infection risk information (numerical vs. graphical), and (3) the behavior of an automated coworker in the facility. We provide evidence that participants changed their behavior when they observed a simulated worker making a choice to follow or not follow a biosecurity protocol, even though the simulated worker had no economic effect on the participants' payouts. These results advance the understanding of human behavioral effects on biosecurity protocol decisions, demonstrating that social cues need to be considered by livestock facility managers when developing policies to make agricultural systems more disease resilient. © Copyright © 2020 Trinity, Merrill, Clark, Koliba, Zia, Bucini and Smith.},

	abstract = {Background and Aim: The implementation of artificial insemination (AI) is one of the strategies to use superior male semen optimally to improve the genetic quality of livestock. One of the factors that influence AI is a fertility-associated antigen (FAA). This research aimed to examine the effects of FAA extracted from the accessory sex glands of a bull from a slaughterhouse that was added in bull semen freezing medium to increase cattle (bull) fertilization. Materials and Methods: This research used a randomized complete block design. It consisted of two research phases, namely, explorative and experimental phases. The first phase involved determining the FAA molecular weight using the SDS-PAGE method, and the second phase consisted of laboratory and field testing, including testing the quality of frozen semen supplemented with FAA extracted from the accessory glands of a bull's genital organ from a slaughterhouse with various doses (0, 5, 10, and 15 μg in every 200 million progressively motile spermatozoa). Results: The results showed that the percentages of bull sperm motility between the groups without and with the additional administration of FAA with a dose of 5 μg did not significantly differ. However, there was a difference between the groups without and with the additional administration of FAA with doses of 10 and 15 μg. After further testing, the highest percentage of sperm progressive motility occurred at a dose of 15 μg/200 million progressively motile spermatozoa (P3), which was equal to 2.59±46.88b (%). Conclusion: This research found that not all of the accessory glands (seminal vesicles) of bulls taken from the slaughterhouse contain the FAA. An FAA level between the accessory glands (seminal vesicles) of one cattle to another is different. The addition of the FAA protein from the accessory sex glands of a bull's organ in cattle semen can improve fertility by increasing the percentage of viability, motility, intact plasma membrane of spermatozoa, and pregnancy rate of bulls and decreasing the sperm capacitation post-thawing. © 2020 Veterinary World.

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major health threat for public and animal health in the twenty-first century. In Ecuador, antibiotics have been used by the poultry industry for decades resulting in the presence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria in the poultry meat production chain, with the consequent risk for public health. This study evaluated the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC and mcr genes in third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli (3GC-R E. coli) isolated from broiler farms (animal component), broiler carcasses (food component), and human enteritis (human component) in Quito-Ecuador. Samples were collected weekly from November 2017 to November 2018. For the animal, food, and human components, 133, 335, and 302 samples were analyzed, respectively. Profiles of antimicrobial resistance were analyzed by an automated microdilution system. Resistance genes were studied by PCR and Sanger sequencing. From all samples, 122 (91.7%), 258 (77%), and 146 (48.3%) samples were positive for 3GC-R E. coli in the animal, food, and human components, respectively. Most of the isolates (472/526, 89.7%) presented MDR phenotypes. The ESBL blaCTX-M-55, blaCTX-M-3, blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-65, blaCTX-M-27, and blaCTX-M-14 were the most prevalent ESBL genes while blaCMY-2 was the only AmpC detected gene. The mcr-1 gene was found in 20 (16.4%), 26 (10.1%), and 3 (2.1%) of isolates from animal, food, and human components, respectively. The implication of poultry products in the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC and mcr genes in 3GC-R must be considered in the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance. © Copyright © 2020 Ortega-Paredes, de Janon, Villavicencio, Ruales, De La Torre, Villacís, Wagenaar, Matheu, Bravo-Vallejo, Fernández-Moreira and Vinueza-Burgos.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture production of finfish has seen rapid growth in production volume and economic yield over the last decades, and is today a key provider of seafood. As the scale of production increases, so does the likelihood that the industry will face emerging biological, economic and social challenges that may influence the ability to maintain ethically sound, productive and environmentally friendly production of fish. It is therefore important that the industry aspires to monitor and control the effects of these challenges to avoid also upscaling potential problems when upscaling production. We introduce the Precision Fish Farming (PFF) concept whose aim is to apply control-engineering principles to fish production, thereby improving the farmer's ability to monitor, control and document biological processes in fish farms. By adapting several core principles from Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), and accounting for the boundary conditions and possibilities that are particular to farming operations in the aquatic environment, PFF will contribute to moving commercial aquaculture from the traditional experience-based to a knowledge-based production regime. This can only be achieved through increased use of emerging technologies and automated systems. We have also reviewed existing technological solutions that could represent important components in future PFF applications. To illustrate the potential of such applications, we have defined four case studies aimed at solving specific challenges related to biomass monitoring, control of feed delivery, parasite monitoring and management of crowding operations. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {The mounting behavior of pigs is generally manifested as a pig puts two front legs on the body or head of another pig which stays lying or dodged quickly. Mounting between pigs often causes epidermal wounds and even fractures, which reduces animal welfare and affects the economic benefits. Therefore, it is necessary to isolate the mounting pigs in time. In view of the low degree of automation of current mounting behavior detection of pigs, an algorithm based on Mask R-CNN was proposed to recognize the mounting behavior of pigs. Firstly, the top view videos of pigs were shot, and the dataset labels were made by Labelme. The transfer learning was applied to train the ResNet-FPN network to obtain the pig segmentation result and extract the mask pixel area in each sample. The value of the minimum mask pixel area in each sample was extracted in order to build an empirical sample set for mounting behavior recognition, and the discriminant threshold of the mounting behavior of pigs was determined. In the experiment, the test dataset was used to evaluate the pig segmentation network model and the mounting behavior recognition algorithm. The segmentation accuracy of the network was 94%, and the accuracy of the mounting behavior recognition algorithm was 94.5%. The experimental results showed that the algorithm can effectively detect the mounting behavior of pigs and provide support for livestock breeding automation. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

	abstract = {The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has recognised that the production of pre-sexed livestock by sperm or embryo sexing as a useful breeding tool to increase production efficiency, especially for traits that are sexrelated. In this chapter, we briefly explain sex determination in mammals, review approaches to identifying X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm and their practical implications for semen handling and artificial insemination (AI) and compare their importance and success in the main farm animal species. The problems associated with current technology for sperm sexing, as reflected in the damage caused to mammalian sperm are then considered, followed by an assessment of the potential for replacing this technology by other methods. In mammals, the most efficient method to bias sex ratios in offspring is to separate X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm by flow cytometry before insemination. Numerous other techniques purporting to alter the sex ratio have been proposed or discussed. None of these were able to produce significant separation of fertile X and/or Y sperm populations or were not repeatable. Only quantitative methods, which differentiate between X and Y sperm on the basis of total DNA and then apply flow cytometric sorting, have been able to separate the two sperm populations with high accuracy. Sperm are labelled with a DNA fluorescent dye. After recognition and electric charging, droplets containing single sperm are deflected and pushed into a collection medium from which they are further processed. This set-up allows the identification and selection of individual sperm into populations with sort purities above 90% of the desired characteristics A critical point is the orientation of sperm in front of a UV laser, requiring modifications of a standard flow cytometer. A specially designed nozzle assembly hydrodynamically focusses the sperm-containing laminar core stream by means of a sheath fluid and the specific geometrics of the internal assembly parts. Sperm sorting requires special liquid media. For example, a system based on TRIS extender has been developed for bull and ram semen. Besides TRIS and other ingredients, the medium contains antioxidant scavengers to combat reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the Hoechst dye 33342. Porcine semen is handled in a similar way, except that the sample fluid is based on TRIS-HEPES. The sample fluid for stallion semen is generally based on skim milk, INRA 96 or Kenney's modified Tyrode (KMT). Sorted samples are collected in tubes prefilled with collection medium. The composition of this medium is, in most cases, a TEST-yolk extender, supplemented with seminal plasma in order to decapacitate the collected sperm. In the animal industries, changing the sex ratio of offspring can increase genetic progress and productivity. Animal welfare can be improved, for example, by decreasing obstetric difficulties in cattle and minimising environmental impacts by eliminating the unwanted sex. Sexed sperm has been most widely applied in the dairy industry, and it is likely that this will continue, dependent on the market situation. For US dairy farmers, milk production and the sale of surplus calves and cull cows are as important as the production of replacement heifers on-farm. Outside the USA, at least in Europe and Australia, the demand for sexed sperm is potentially high for milk producers to optimise herd management. In these countries, the genetically superior cows will be bred with X chromosome-bearing sperm to produce genetically superior females with high milk yield and for (female) pregnant heifer export to other countries. Besides AI, embryo transfer (ET) can be performed after insemination with sex-sorted sperm. The combination of sex-sorted sperm with in vitro embryo production (IVEP) is advantageous, but much more difficult than ET, and depends on species, individual semen donor and composition of media used for in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and in vitro culture. Commercialisation of sex-sorted ram sperm has, to date, been restricted by the dearth of commercial sorting facilities in Australia and New Zealand, although sheep are the only species in which sex-sorted frozen-thawed sperm have been shown to have comparable, if not superior, fertility to that of non-sorted frozen-thawed controls. Moreover, there has been little incentive to take up the technology due to low rates of adoption of genetic improvement programmes and/or artificial breeding technology. In pigs, apart from economic benefits from faster growth rates, sex-sorted sperm would provide major welfare advantages through the elimination of surgical castration. However, the current method of individual sperm sorting is not efficient enough to satisfy the potential demands of the porcine AI industry, due to the high number of sperm required for each insemination. For special applications, such as building up nucleus herds or for research, sexed boar sperm can be utilised in combination with specially adapted insemination strategies. A signifi-cant reduction in the total sperm dose, maintaining fertility, can be achieved if porcine semen is deposited deep in the uterus in front of the utero-tubal junction or directly into the oviduct. Only very few sperm are required for IVF using in vivo or in vitro matured oocytes. Transferring both gametes into the oviduct at the same time (gamete intrafallopian transfer-GIFT) can be used as an alternative to IVF. Even fewer sperm are required for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) than for all other IVF methods. However, to date, these methods require laparoscopy or laparotomy for insemination, embryo or gamete transfer, which are not practicable as alternatives to castration. In horses the preferred gender depends on the breed and range of use. Stallion sperm have a low sorting index and their sortability varies, not only among stallions but also among ejaculates. Additionally, the freezability of stallion sperm varies widely. Insemination with sex-sorted sperm has to be performed by hysteroscopy deep into the uterine horn, limiting the technology to high-value animals. The sex-sorting process can cause sperm damage. The main sources of damage are incubation with the fluorescent stain and exposure to the UV laser, mechanical forces and electrical charge. Future sorting methods may avoid the need to identify quantitative differences between X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm. This would require a specific marker related to only one sex. A promising system is based on gold nanoparticles, which can be functionalised with DNA probes. After internalisation of the probe into the sperm head, the Y chromosome-bearing sperm can be identified due to their strong plasmon resonance, which is more stable than fluorescent dyes. Non-invasive coupling of a specific DNA probe with the intact DNA double strand by triplex binding and accumulation of nanoparticles has been achieved, but to date internalisation of the gold nanoparticles requires further research. Another promising new method promotes the naturally occurring genomic variations by gene editing. It is not a question of if, only when these methods will be ready for the market and replace the existing sexing techniques. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

	abstract = {Livestock are critical component for supporting the sustainable agriculture in the current global scenario. In the era of artificial intelligence and automation in field of livestock, sensors play an important role. Electrochemical sensor is the type of sensor which holds reliability and tremendous promise in raising the animal productivity in developing world. An early and accurate diagnosis of the animal pathogen and metabolic status are the cornerstone for better animal productivity. The available diagnostic techniques require tedious sample preparation, sophisticated instrument, dedicated laboratory, trained personnel and it is time consuming also. The electrochemical biosensor technology might be a smart solution because of its sensitivity, simplicity, low cost, possible miniaturization and potential ability for real-time analysis. In the veterinary disease diagnostics, various biosensors including electrochemical biosensors have been developed recently, based on disease specific biomarkers. The main focus of article is on reviewing the research in detection of animal infectious and metabolic diseases, hormonal analysis and sweat analysis with electrochemical biosensor. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In this study, expected genetic progress and economic benefits from implementing three community-based breeding programs for sheep (CBBP) out- and upscaling strategies were investigated. Strategy 1 is to replicate average existing CBBPs, strategy 2 is to increase the number of breeding males produced and disseminated by average CBBPs and strategy 3 is to intensify the use of breeding males with artificial insemination (AI). The strategies were modelled using field and market data from Ethiopian Menz sheep. The data included costs incurred by nucleus farmers to run the breeding program and base farmers to pay for improved rams. Genetic progress in six-month weight and economic benefit in US dollars with a reference planning horizon (H) of 20 years and a discount rate (r) of 0.07 were calculated using gene flow techniques. Genetic progress expected in average existing CBBPs came to 0.11 kg/year and accumulated discounted economic benefit (income/costs) was USD54,290 with a return on investment (income/costs) of USD5.1 per dollar invested. Thus, strategy 1, which replicates ongoing CBBPs, ranked highly beneficial. Strategy 2 was tested with 200 improved rams purchased at 1.1 times their meat market value. Accumulated discounted economic benefit with this strategy resulted in USD133,317 and return on investment was calculated at USD14.1. Cost of improved rams would need to be 2.5 times the current meat market value to make this strategy unprofitable. Strategy 3, taking advantage of AI, was tested in two ways: using fewer rams to increase selection differential in the nucleus of a CBBP (strategy 3a) and increasing the number of ewes in general herds served with improved rams (strategy 3b). Feasible AI programs were modelled allowing for lower conception rates and including all AI costs in the economic analyses. Strategy 3a increased genetic progress of six-month weight from 0.11 to 0.14 kg/year and strategy 3b increased the number of improved lambs from 7290 to 12,474. Therefore, incomes became larger but so did costs, leading to very low or negative benefits. Considering a shorter planning horizon (H = 10) and a larger discount rate (r = 0.12) would reduce benefits and returns to investment but would not change the general finding that out-scaling current CBBPs or upscaling the number of improved males from current CBBPs for dissemination are highly recommendable strategies for livestock development. However, AI, at current conception rates and costs, can only be justified with major subsidies or under specific circumstances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Monitoring livestock behaviour can be a useful way to improve farm animal management and to detect individual health events. The use of automated systems that predict several daily behaviours from accelerometer data is growing and studies have often focused on the comparison of datamining classification methods. However, few studies have attempted to evaluate the effect of the step preceding the classification, namely accelerometer signal pre-processing. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of several pre-processing methods on the prediction of dairy cows behaviour from accelerometer data. Ten Holstein cows equipped with a three-dimensional accelerometer fixed on a neck collar were simultaneously observed by two observers. Observed behaviours were predicted with decision tree using pre-processed accelerometer data as inputs. Different procedures were evaluated for each of these following pre-processing steps: signal filtering, signal segmentation and feature calculation. For signal filtering, low-pass filters and high-pass filters were considered. For signal segmentation, various window sizes and percentages of overlap between windows were implemented. Sixty-one features were computed. This resulted in 150 different combinations of pre-processing steps. For each combination a decision tree model predicting the observed behaviours was trained. The performance of each model to predict the observed behaviours was compared based on accuracy and F-score measures. The relative importance of each pre-processing configuration on the performance of prediction was evaluated with a linear regression model. The best configurations led to an accuracy of 0.95 and a F-score of 0.96 against 0.76 and 0.65 respectively with the worse combinations. The best combinations included a window size of 20 s and 30 s, with an overlap of 90% and no high-pass filter. High-pass filter had the most significant effect on the classification (P < 0.001), with a substantial decrease when it was applied. Performance of the classification was also significantly improved when increasing the percentage of overlapping (P < 0.001). The decline of the accuracy observed for the window size of 20 s without overlap was prevented when an overlap higher than 50% was applied. This suggested that overlap should be considered when there is not sufficient data available. No impact was found for the low-pas filter. In conclusion, the way of pre-processing the accelerometer signal deserves to be considered in the classification and adapted according to the aim and design of the study. © 2019},

The experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions in a completely randomized experimental design with five replicates, where the treatments were constituted by herbicides: isoxaflutole, applied at the doses of 100, 200, and 300 g ai ha-1; pendimethalin, at 500, 1000, and 4000 g ai ha-1; and trifluralin, at 600, 1200, and 2400 g ai ha-1; in addition to a control treatment, without the application of herbicides. Herbicide phytotoxicity was evaluated at 35 days after emergence for the number of emerged seedlings, number of leaves per seedling, seedling height and diameter, and root and shoot dry weight. With the results obtained, it is possible to affirm that under the conditions of the experiment, all the herbicides and doses used did not affect the emergence and early development of seedlings of species H. stigonocarpa and B. orellana. For species A. hasslerii, the dose of 300 g ai ha-1 of herbicide isoxaflutole was not selective.

	abstract = {Challenges to ensiling are coming from a wide spectrum. Faster harvest rates are making it more difficult to achieve target silage densities. Larger harvest equipment is increasing soil compaction and rural road issues. Older silos are too small and are overfilled, creating safety issues, or temporary piles are placed on bare ground permitting soil contamination. Mycotoxins and other pathogens in silages are still a problem. Global warming may affect the forage crops grown and crop characteristics as well as rates of silage fermentation and aerobic deterioration. Silage as an input to bio-refineries has an unclear future. Silage analysis is challenged by sampling and knowing what components truly predict nutritional value. The future holds many opportunities for both ensiling and silage research. Robotic harvesting will release more labour for silo packing, and there are opportunities to develop tools to estimate silage density during filling. Total mixed ration silages should allow more by-products in rations. The development of novel silage additives to improve silage hygiene or increase nutrient availability appears promising. Predicting the onset of aerobic deterioration with quick tests for lactate-assimilating yeasts or silage temperatures seems possible. Metabolomics and metabonomics, in addition to the microbiome tools in development, put us at the cusp of being able to see which microorganisms are active in the silo and rumen and what compounds of significance they are producing. This could lead to many advances in silage quality including reduced microbial toxins, better hygiene and improved utilization by livestock. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Despite this potential, they have not yet found widespread application in animal welfare monitoring. In this review, we first discuss current trends in sound analysis for ecology, conservation and sound classification. Following this, we detail the vocalizations produced by three of the most important farm livestock species: chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and cattle (Bos taurus). Finally, we describe how these methods can be applied to monitor animal welfare with new potential for developing automated methods for large-scale farming. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

With their help, it is possible to achieve a significant increase in labor productivity and crop yields and reduce energy and material costs. Digital machine technologies should be applied in crop growing, livestock breeding, power engineering, and storage and processing of agricultural products. In addition, a comprehensive system for management of agricultural enterprises is required, which will ensure the timely and correct execution of tasks. In digital machines and agricultural technologies, four main areas are distinguished: monitoring of conditions and process parameters, transmission and storage of information, artificial intelligence and cloud technologies, and implementation of management decisions by robotic technical means. The main objects of monitoring are soils, plants, animals, weather and climatic conditions, technical means, and technological processes. Various monitoring tools transmit data in real time to the cloud platform and on the basis of artificial intelligence optimizes technological operations and gives the command to executive mechanisms. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Maize is the main food crop that meets the nutritional needs of both humans and livestock in the sub-Saharan African region. Maize crop has in the recent past been threatened by the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, J. E Smith) which has caused considerable maize yield losses in the region. Controlling this pest requires knowledge on the time, location and extent of infestation. In addition, the insect pest's abundance and environmental conditions should be predicted as early as possible for integrated pest management to be effective. Consequently, a fall armyworm pheromone trap was deployed as a monitoring tool in the present study. The trap inspection is currently carried out manually every week. The purpose of this paper is to bring automation to the trap. We modify the trap and integrate Internet of Things technologies which include a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ micro-computer, Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller, 3G cellular modem and various sensors powered with an off-grid solar photovoltaic system to capture real-time fall armyworm moth images, environmental conditions and provide real-time indications of the pest occurrences. The environmental conditions include Geographical Positioning System coordinates, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. The captured images together with environmental conditions are uploaded to the cloud server where the image is classified instantly using Google's pre-trained InceptionV3 Machine Learning model. Intended users view captured data including prediction accuracy via a web application. Once this smart technology is adopted, the labour-intensive task of monitoring will reduce while stakeholders shall be provided with a near real-time insight into the FAW situation in the field therefore enabling pro-activeness in their management of such a devastating pest. © 2019 Simon H.

	abstract = {Pig counting is one of the most critical topics in farming management and asset estimation. Due to its complexity, traditional agriculture method relies on manual counting, which is obviously inefficient and a waste of manpower. The challenging aspects like partial occlusion, overlapping and different perspectives even limit the usage of traditional computer vision techniques. In recent years, deep learning has become more and more popular for computer vision applications, because of its superior performance comparing to traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a deep learning solution to address the pig counting problem. We present a modified Counting Convolutional Neural Network (Counting CNN) model according to the structure of ResNeXt, and tune a series of experimental parameters. Our CNN model learns the mapping from the image feature to the density map, and obtains the total number of pigs in the entire image by integrating the density map. In order to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset collected from actual piggery farming with 15 pigs in an image averagely. We achieve 1.67 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) per image and outperforms the competing algorithms, which strongly demonstrates that our proposed method can accurately estimate the number of pigs even if they are partially occluded in different perspectives. The detection speed, 42 ms per image, meets the requirements of agricultural application. We share our code and the first pig dataset we collected for pig counting at https://github.com/xixiareone/counting-pigs for livestock husbandry and science research community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Avian Influenza (AI) in poultry farms in Indonesia is still a threat to the sustainability of livestock and farmers. Duck is one of the most heterogeneous natural reservoirs and hosts of AI viruses. This study aims to detect antibody titer AI levels in blood serum and duck eggs as well as to know the different hematology profile of Tegal and Magelang ducks in Central Java. Research method was survey at farmer level. Farmer and duck samples were determined by purposive random sampling of 10 breeders for each region. Selection of respondents and ducks was based on the number of duck owners and duck age. The samples of farmers and ducks taken were determined randomly as many as 10 breeders in each area and from each breeder was selected 6 female ducks for their blood and 10 eggs to be analyzed using antibody titer against AI. The variables measured in this study were antibody titer against AI measured on blood serum and serum egg yolk, with inhibition hemagglutination test and haematological profile. The data obtained were analyzed using T-test. The results showed protective antibodies against AI on blood serum Tegal ducks (seropositive) 58% while Magelang ducks 46%. Titer of serum antibodies of Tegal duck in the range of 22-25 while Magelang ducks 22-26. Titer of egg antibody in Tegal ducks in the range of 20-210 while Magelang ducks 20-27. T-test on AI antibody titer on blood serum and serum of eggs of Tegal duck and Magelang ducks (which have different environment) showed no significant difference (P> 0.05). The result of T-test on leukocyte fraction profile showed that on heterophile, lymphocyte, and H / L both ducks showed a very significant difference (P <0.01). Higher H / L values in Tegal ducks show stress due to heat stress. T-test on red blood cells, white blood cells, hemoglobin, packed cell volume (PCV), total plasma proteins, eosinophils, monocytes, fibrinogen and albumin showed no significant difference (P> 0.05). The study concluded that there was no difference of antibody titer level to AI and hematology profile in Tegal and Magelang ducks despite different maintenance environment. However, Tegal duck was indicative of higher stress with higher H / L values than Magelang duck. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

State of the art trajectory prediction models using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) do not currently account for a planned future action of a robot, and so cannot predict how an individual will move in response to a robot’s planned path. We propose an approach that adapts RNNs to use a robot’s next planned action as an input alongside the current position of nearby individuals. This allows the model to learn the response of individuals with regards to a robot’s motion from real world observations. By linking a robot’s actions to the response of those around it in training, we show that we are able to not only improve prediction accuracy in close range interactions, but also to predict the likely response of surrounding individuals to simulated actions. This allows the use of the model to simulate state transitions, without requiring any assumptions on agent interaction. We apply this model to varied datasets, including crowds of pedestrians interacting with vehicles and bicycles, and livestock interacting with a robotic vehicle. © 2019 Australasian Robotics and Automation Association.

BCS heavily influences milk production, reproduction, and health of cows. Therefore, it is important to monitor BCS to achieve better animal response, but this is a time-consuming and subjective task performed visually by expert scorers. Several studies have tried to automate BCS of dairy cows by applying image analysis and machine learning techniques. This work analyzes these studies and proposes a system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve overall automatic BCS estimation, whose use might be extended beyond dairy production. The developed system has achieved good estimation results in comparison with other systems in the area. Overall accuracy of BCS estimations within 0.25 units of difference from true values was 78%, while overall accuracy within 0.50 units was 94%. Similarly, weighted precision and recall, which took into account imbalance BCS distribution in the built dataset, show similar values considering those error ranges. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The growing size of livestock herds has led farmers to lose individual contact with their animals, while behavioral studies show that breeders can effectively and precisely monitor a herd of up to 100 cows. This was the main motivation for this study, which aims to identify and test various electronic devices which provide useful herd management data, including estrus detection, individual activity and body temperature measurement, monitoring rumen pH levels, milk quality and content as well as milk temperature and somatic cell count measurements. Some devices can detect the metabolic status of animals with a reasonable level of precision. Contemporary animal farms are offered a large number of systems for monitoring the behavior of the animals in the herd and helping to identify those that are intended for insemination or are too active or excessively apathetic. Monitoring devices support herd management and help to reduce costs through the early detection of animal diseases and nutritional problems. This review aims to compile and summarize the information currently available on the use of automatic herd control systems on dairy farms, as well as to discuss the interpretation of the results, providing a useful diagnostic tool in nutritional evaluations of dairy herds. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {Vegetable producers are often concerned about potential herbicide carryover and injury to vegetables following the application of livestock manure/compost from animals fed with treated hay. A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the effect of activated charcoal on soil residual activity of the herbicides aminopyralid, aminocyclopyrachlor, and picloram, applied at recommended field rates of 120 g ae, 70 g ai, and 303 g ai ha−1 respectively, on tomato, okra, and cantaloupe. A commercial source of activated charcoal was used at four rates [0, 0.5X, 1X, and 2X (1X = 336 kg ha−1)]. When no activated charcoal was applied, aminopyralid caused the greatest injury to tomato and okra, leading to plant death at 4 weeks after emergence/transplanting (WAE/T). At the highest rate (2X) of activated charcoal, crop injuries due to aminopyralid were reduced by 72 and 78% for okra and cantaloupe, respectively at 4 WAE, while tomato did not respond to the 2X rate of activated charcoal. For aminocyclopyrachlor, even a much lower rate (0.5X) of activated charcoal was sufficient to reduce about 70% of the injury caused on cantaloupe and okra. For picloram, activated charcoal application at the 2X rate reduced injury by 78–94% across the three vegetable species investigated. Under low herbicide residue levels that usually occur under carryover situations, a much lower rate of activated charcoal (<100 kg ha−1) may be sufficient and practically feasible. Overall, activated charcoal application shows promise for remediating soil contaminated with herbicide residues, but crop response can be variable and requires optimization for specific herbicide, species, and use scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Cutting-edge remote sensing technology provides an efficient and affordable way for acquiring point clouds of livestock, so that automated procedures of obtaining body measurements need to be established. A novel pose normalization method for 3D point clouds of livestock with similar forms of cows or pigs based on its bilateral symmetry properties is proposed in order to increase the degree of measuring automation. The proposed algorithm is combined in a hybrid scheme, which serves as the pose normalization procedure in an automatic body measurement system for livestock. Our extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world point clouds data show that the proposed approach has potential for generalizing well across livestock species and handles noise successfully in test data. In addition, the proposed pose normalization scheme outperforms current standard approach Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and state-of-the-art pose normalization method for pigs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI) is widely used for livestock breeding. Although sperm cryopreservation is the most efficient method for long-term storage, its use for porcine AI is marginal, because of its dramatic impact on sperm quality. While the removal of seminal plasma is a routine practice prior to porcine sperm cryopreservation, its beneficial role on sperm function has not been investigated in as much detail. In this context and despite seminal plasma being regarded as a mere vehicle of sperm, mounting evidence indicates that it could be positive for porcine sperm fertility. In effect, not only is seminal plasma able to interact with the female reproductive tract after mounting/insemination, but it has been demonstrated it modulates sperm function. For this reason, the composition of this fluid and its proteome have begun to be investigated in order to elucidate whether its components play any role in sperm function, fertility and cryotolerance. Previous research has demonstrated that seminal plasma may maintain the quality and fertilizing ability of frozen-thawed boar spermatozoa when added before or after cryopreservation. However, a large variety of results have been reported with both beneficial and detrimental effects, including studies in which no influence has been observed. This review examines the composition of porcine seminal plasma and summarizes the available published studies regarding seminal plasma supplementation to spermatozoa before or after freeze-thawing. The take-home message of this article is that clearing up the role of seminal plasma in sperm cryotolerance may increase the reproductive performance of frozen-thawed boar spermatozoa. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Milk production in the implementation of a competent management approach is a profitable agricultural business. To improve management decision making, regular monitoring of the situation on the milk market is needed. Our analysis showed that, despite the reduction in the number of dairy cows in all forms of management and despite the decline in milk production, in the period from 1990 to 2016 in the agricultural organizations of the country, the productivity of dairy cows increased by two folds. Secondly, the cost of producing one center of milk decreased four-fold, which indicates the processes, innovations, mechanization and automation of production are in place and working well. Thirdly, labor costs per cow, in man-hours decreased by 2.5 times. Fourthly, it is positive that the loss of milk decreased by half. Fifthly, the export of milk, which includes exports both to non-CIS countries and the CIS, has increased by 93%. In order to identify the factors that affect the productivity of dairy cows, we performed a special correlation regression analysis. Our analysis allows us to conclude that the most significant factors affecting the productivity of dairy cows are: (1) the cost per year for the maintenance of one cow, in thousands of rubles; (2) labor costs for the production of one center of milk, man-hours; (3) the number of livestock per 100 hectares of agricultural land, heads; (4) the mass of one calf at birth, in kilograms; (5) the load per operator of machine milking, heads; (5) average monthly salary of a machine milking operator, rubles. The state regulation of dairy cattle breeding should be carried out on the basis of competent economic mechanisms, it presupposes rationalization of the structure of agricultural production, inter-industry and inter-farm relations, the creation of stable economic, legal and social conditions for the development of agriculture, taking into account the already achieved production results, available and potential resource base, especially availability of basic production assets. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Nevertheless, dairy heifers are still measured manually, a time consuming and stressful task for both the farmer and the animal. This research suggests an approach that utilises a fully automated system to measure a heifer's body. The methodology involves a single low-cost Microsoft Kinect V2 Time-of-Flight 3D sensor, computer vision, machine learning, and object recognition using ellipse fitting with quantile regression as part of the feature extraction phase. The camera was installed at the Volcani Center dairy farm, on the ceiling above a free-walk path between the feeding zone and lying area. Video data of 107 Israeli Holstein heifers were recorded and validated against “gold references” (human-observed body mass, hip height and withers height). The tested system improved the normalised Root Mean Squared Error of estimates over the state of the art models by 70.4%, 69.8% and 42.6% for withers height, hip height, and body mass respectively. The models were also validated on a different dairy farm and yielded similar results. The methodology, may be adapted and applied to other elliptically shaped animal bodies, such as sheep, pigs, horses, and buffalo. © 2017 IAgrE},

In this study, the hypothesis tested was that the body contour of a fatter dairy cow is plumper than that of a thin dairy cow and, therefore, may better fit a paraboloid surface. Depth image processing and fitting model were investigated and consisted of three stages: (1) object location and separation of individual cow; (2) image surface fitting; and (3) parameters determination in body condition scoring (BCS) model. Compared with the previous studies, the novelty in this paper was completing the full-automation of a BCS system. The proposed model was trained and tested with the BCS value obtained manually. Pearson correlation between the proposed BCS and the manual BCS was 0.84 for the test data set. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An automatic milking system allows cows to present their full production capability by not limiting them to a specific time when the milking occurs or a fix number of milkings per day. The beginning of the first lactation is a key point in terms of subsequent milk production. The aim of the present study was to indicate the relationship between the milking frequency of primiparous cows during the first month of lactation and their subsequent milk performance. Material of the study consisted of 25 Polish herds of Holstein-Friesian dairy cattle. All cows were milked with the use of an automatic milking system. Animals were divided into five groups, depending on the milking frequency in the first month after calving (MFF). The collected data were statistically processed using the multifactorial ANOVA. The best milk and milking parameters characterised primiparous cows, for which the average number of milkings per day was at the level of 3-3.5 or above, this group did not have a preferred time for their milking. This group of cows milked more frequently during the first month of lactation (MFF5) and had the highest milk yield (MY) and milking duration. The highest culling percentage (57.77%) was noted within the group of primiparous cows with the lowest milking frequency during the first month of lactation (MFF1). MFF5 animals maintained better milk and milking parameters in all months of lactation than did those in the other groups. Older animals, that calved after the 28th month of life, and those that calved during warmer seasons, showed the tendency to have a lower milking frequency and poorer milk and milking parameters. The findings obtained in the present study are interesting in terms of their potential use, because they show that frequent milking during the first month after calving corresponds to a better overall MY during that lactation. Hopefully, by promoting frequent milkings at the beginning of lactation, farmer may increase the overall lactation MY. © 2020 CSIRO.},

However, it remains unclear whether the goal of PLF development has been to improve welfare or increase production efficiency. The aims of this systematic literature review are to provide an overview of the current state of PLF in poultry farming and investigate whether the focus of PLF research has been to improve bird welfare. The study characteristics extracted from 264 peer-reviewed publications and conference proceedings suggest that poultry PLF has received increasing attention on a global scale, but is yet to become a widespread commercial reality. PLF development has most commonly focussed on broiler farming, followed by laying hens, and mainly involves the use of sensors (environmental and wearable) and cameras. More publications had animal health and welfare than production as either one of or the only goal, suggesting that PLF development so far has focussed on improving animal health and welfare. Future work should prioritise improving the rate of commercialisation of PLF systems, so that their potential to improve bird welfare might be realised. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Early and accurate diagnosis of pregnancy in animals is important for improving the reproductive management of livestock. The buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is the most important dairy animal in India, but there are reproductive problems resulting from extended calving interval and ovulation occurring in the absence of behavioral estrus. The lack of simple methods for early pregnancy diagnosis intensifies these problems. The present study, therefore, was conducted to ascertain the role of the interferon-stimulated gene, (ISG), 15 in pregnancy detection. The anti-ISG15 Mab based ELISA was developed that could be used for detecting pregnancy at 18 to 20 days after artificial insemination (AI). The ISG15 protein was isolated from a pregnant buffalo and was amplified, and cloned in Escherichia coli by using coding region primers. The ISG15 gene was expressed in the host Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and the protocol was standardized for optimum gene expression. Using immortal hybridoma (fused myeloma and B cells) cells, a highly specific and sensitive antibody, anti-ISG15 mAb, for detecting ISG15 (protein) in the serum of pregnant buffaloes was obtained. A blocking ELISA was developed using the anti-ISG15 mAb to detect pregnancy in buffalo within 18 to 21 days after AI. The ISG15 gene was upregulated (P < 0.05) in pregnant buffalo at 18 to 21 days of pregnancy. This assay has an overall diagnostic accuracy of 75.0%. It, therefore, is concluded that recombinant ISG15 retains the potential for detecting pregnancy in B. bubalis and may have applications in ELISA kits for pregnancy detection in closely related species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

For this, we analyzed 2 395 individual artificial insemination (AI) records during the 2010-2016 period. The results obtained reveal high THI values ​​during the summer, exceeding 80 units, and leading to a considerable drop in CR1% (<50%). In terms of fertility, there is a significant difference (p <0.05) between seasons and breeds, with a superiority for Montbeliarde over Holstein during the periods of heat stress, giving a correlation with the THI of r = - 0.73 (Holstein) vs r = -0.65 (Montbeliarde).

	abstract = {Automation of the measurement of the physiological and behavioural parameters of livestock has become an important goal for both scientists and farmers. Accurate data and knowledge about farmed animals, especially in cattle breeding, are needed. Proper early diagnosis of a cow's health status in real time allows for preventing the development of infection, oestrus detection and leads to reduced environmental stress. Thus, it contributes to more effective herd management. Among the physiological parameters, body temperature and its fluctuations are key indicators of health and well-being in animals. Currently, along with the development of technical solutions and their implementation, increasingly more attention is being paid to the continuously measurement of body core and peripheral temperature in animals. Recently there has been an increased number of publications devoted to this subject. However, there is a need to systematise this knowledge as these studies have had different purposes, have been performed in various environmental conditions, and the measurements were taken using different methods and equipment. As such, the results obtained by the different authors often may not be comparable. For this reason, this paper has two main purposes: to present the most widely used continuous methods of peripheral and body core temperature measurement, and to show its references values which characterise the individual locations of the cattle body in thermoneutral ambient. An analysis of the professional publications regarding measurements of peripheral and deep body temperature led to the conclusion that these methods have high research and diagnostic potential. However, it is necessary to standardised research to enable better and more comparable results, including among others; different cattle groups, animal age, health and environmental conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As increasing number of studies for body measurement purposes in both the animal breeding and production stages, several papers have already evaluated the feasibility of consumer depth sensors for linear body measurement of livestock including pigs and cows. However, taking heart girth measurements is one of the major problems in livestock farming and the current studies remain under-evaluated for automated extraction of livestock girth measurements. In this paper, we develop a novel automatic measurement method for pig heart girth from body surface point clouds. Firstly, we preprocess the original point cloud data with methods including segmentation and pose normalization. Secondly, we resort to point cloud cross-section feature to detect the measuring position of the heart girth. Thirdly, the heart girth point clouds is achieved by slicing point cloud on the measuring position. Finally, the length of the heart girth is obtained by approximating the perimeter of the curve fitted by the heart girth point clouds. Experimental results show that the correct detection rate of measuring position of pig heart girth is 96.5% and the average relative error for heart girth from our method is 7.87%, which demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed measurement method.

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of smallholder beef cattle production in Central Vietnam. A total of 360 households were interviewed by using semi-structured questionnaire; a total of 606 beef cows were investigated for evaluating calving interval (CI). Thirty-two fattening cattle were monitored for the estimation of diet structure. Results showed that the cattle herd size was 4.32-4.45 cattle/household. In North Central (NC), 55% of surveyed farmers kept local cattle, 45% kept crossbreeds, and none of surveyed farmers keeping exotic breeds. In South Central (SC), 63% of surveyed farmers kept cross cattle, 32% kept local cattle, and 5% kept exotic breeds. In the breeding method, 70% of surveyed farmers used artificial insemination (AI), 20% used natural mating (NM), and only 10% used both AI and NM in SC, whereas in NC 40% of farmers used AI, 40% used NM, and 20% used both AI and NM. The variety of feedstuffs fed to cattle including roughages and concentrate. The concentrate in the diet for fattening cattle was 25%-35% and protein level was 11%-13%, and the average daily gain of cattle was 0.51-0.63 kg/day. The CI of cows was 12-13 months in SC, whereas in NC it was 13-14 months. There were numerous constraints to cattle production in surveyed households including diseases, lack of good quality feed sources, breeds, knowledge, and lack of capital. In conclusion, cattle production in Central Vietnam is small scale and still largely extensive. There are constraints that must be solved to improve livestock systems in the near future, especially when shifting towards semi-intensive and/or intensive cattle production systems. © 2019, Tropical Animal Science Journal.},

Understanding this resilience is essential for managing the health of humans and their livestock. It has long been difficult to quantify resilience directly, forcing practitioners to rely on indirect static indicators of health. However, measurements from wearable electronics and other sources now allow us to analyze the dynamics of physiology and behavior with unsurpassed resolution. The resulting flood of data coincides with the emergence of novel analytical tools for estimating resilience from the pattern of microrecoveries observed in natural time series. Such dynamic indicators of resilience may be used to monitor the risk of systemic failure across systems ranging from organs to entire organisms.

	abstract = {Use of information theory can be an alternative statistical approach to detect genome regions and candidate genes that are associated with livestock traits. The aim of this study was to verify the validity of the SNPs effects on some semen quality variables of bulls using entropy analysis. Records from 288 Holstein-Friesian bulls from one AI station were included. The following semen quality variables were analyzed: CASA kinematic variables of sperm (total motility, average path velocity, straight line velocity, curvilinear velocity, amplitude of lateral head displacement, beat cross frequency, straightness, linearity), sperm membrane integrity (plazmolema, mitochondrial function), sperm ATP content. Molecular data included 48,192 SNPs. After filtering (call rate = 0.95 and MAF = 0.05), 34,794 SNPs were included in the entropy analysis. The entropy and conditional entropy were estimated for each SNP. Conditional entropy quantifies the remaining uncertainty about values of the variable with the knowledge of SNP. The most informative SNPs for each variable were determined. The computations were performed using the R statistical package. A majority of the loci had relatively small contributions. The most informative SNPs for all variables were mainly located on chromosomes: 3, 4, 5 and 16. The results from the study indicate that important genome regions and candidate genes that determine semen quality variables in bulls are located on a number of chromosomes. Some detected clusters of SNPs were located in RNA (U6 and 5S_rRNA) for all the variables for which analysis occurred. Associations between PARK2 as well GALNT13 genes and some semen characteristics were also detected. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Various technologies are already deployed producing a large amount of data, which can be utilised to guide decision-making to improve productivity, reduce wastage, and increase traceability across the AgriFood supply chain. RESULTS: Several examples of the use of data are given, including improving efficiency in livestock production, supporting automation and use of robotics in crop production, increasing food safety and evidencing its provenance. The opportunities and ways forward were discussed at a workshop in November 2017, run by the Society of Chemical Industry and the Knowledge Transfer Network in the United Kingdom. CONCLUSION: This article presents a summary of the key messages from the presentations and focus-group discussions during this event, as interpreted by the authors. A number of challenges in digitalisation of the AgriFood supply chain are discussed, such as low inter-operability of different data sets, silo mentality, low willingness to share data and a significant skills gap. Various approaches are presented that could help to unlock the benefits of using data, from practical support to producers and addressing skills gaps, to industrial leadership and the role of government departments and regulatory bodies in leading by example. Looking forward, data are already revolutionising the AgriFood supply chain, however, the benefits will remain piecemeal until the leaders of today are able to bring together the disparate groups into a cohesive whole. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {To have more economic profitability from buffalo dairy business, timely estrus detection and right timed insemination is the key to success but accurate and timely detection of estrus period has remained a challenging task for the livestock breeders particularly in buffaloes. Silent estrus is important factor which hamper reproductive performance in buffaloes. Proper estrus detection is the biggest constraint in attaining high conception rate in buffaloes. Contemporary practice for estrus detection relies on the visual observation of estrus-specific behaviours/signs. This study proposes the design of a Decision Support System based on acoustic features of vocalization for estrus detection in buffaloes. Threshold values of acoustic features along with animal number were used as input variables. So, two types of conditions (positive estrus and negative estrus) were identified by DSS based on vocal cues of Murrah buffaloes. Accuracy and efficiency of DSS model for estrus detection were found to be 95% and 78.94%, respectively. This study explores the potential use of vocal cues for the development of algorithms for automation and precision livestock farming in commercial dairy buffalo farms. Moreover, this study is a proof that DSS based on animal calls may be a corrigible method to get clue about estrus phase in buffaloes especially during daytime when chances of silent estrus are more. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Avian influenza (AI) is a viral disease of birds that can be transmitted to other animals including humans. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 occurred in poultry in Africa for the first time in 2006 following its emergence in Asia. Subsequent spread of the infection, multiple introductions, and fatal transmission to humans globally and in some African countries and connected regions underscore the importance of this transboundary animal disease to livestock, livelihoods, and public health. The prevention and control of future AI outbreaks in order to mitigate its socioeconomic and public health impact cannot be overemphasized. Repeated incursions of HPAI into Africa and intermingling of multiple susceptible hosts could drive emergence of pathogens at the interface between humans and animals in a shared environment. Intersectoral synergy for the control and mitigation of avian influenza based on the principles of One Health is therefore desirable. The need to understand the nature of the disease, its epidemiology, distribution, applied surveillance strategies, diagnosis, and measures for its control are germane and discussed in this chapter as it applies to Sahelian Africa and connected regions. Basic knowledge of influenza virus and its impact on human and animal health would help to better prepare the next generation of professionals to cope with the rapidly evolving challenges posed by this infectious disease of global reckoning. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {                             The search for medications to treat prion diseases has lasted more than 30 years but no clinically validated treatments for prion diseases of humans or livestock have been realized. A primary strategy has been to identify molecules that can inhibit the formation of pathological forms of prion protein, for example, protease-resistant forms called PrP                             res                             . Such inhibitors can prolong the lives of experimental animals inoculated peripherally with prions, but the practical therapeutic efficacy of known inhibitors against ongoing brain infections has so far been limited by toxicity, insufficient bioavailability to the CNS, and/or strain specificities. Thus, the search continues for clinically applicable inhibitors of PrP                             res                              accumulation. Here we highlight key cell-free assays that are useful for the initial screening and mechanistic characterization of such compounds and are relatively high throughput, rapid, and cost-effective. These include cell-free conversions, protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), real time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), and fluorescence correlation-based competitive binding assays.                          © 2018},

	abstract = {Background: The application of cryopreservation and artificial insemination technology have contributed to the advancement of animal reproduction. However, a substantial proportion of spermatozoa undergoes alterations and loses their fertility during cryopreservation, rendering the frozen-thawed semen impractical for routine use. Cryopreservation is known to reduce sperm lifespan and fertility. Variation in cryosurvival of spermatozoa from different sires and even with the individual sire is common in artificial insemination (AI) centers. Our goal is to improve post-thawed semen quality by optimization of cryopreservation technique through sperm selection prior to cryopreservation process. Results: Our strategy of sperm selection based on rheotaxis and thermotaxis (SSRT) on macrosale in a rotating fluid flow demonstrated the ability to maintain the original pre-freezing structural integrity, viability and biological function related to fertilization competence. This strategy has a positive effect on the cryosurvival and fertilizing abilities of spermatozoa as supported by the improvement on pregnancy rate of Japanese Black heifers and Holstein repeat breeders. This technique protected further sublethal damage to bovine spermatozoa (higher % cryosurvival than the control) and resulted in the improvement of DNA integrity. Prefreeze selected spermatozoa demonstrated slower and controlled capacitation than unprocessed control which is thought to be related to sperm longevity and consequently to appropriate timing during in vivo fertilization. Conclusions: These results provide solid evidence that improvement of post-thawed semen quality by SSRT method is beneficial in terms of cryosurvival, longevity of post-thawed sperm, and optimization of in vivo fertilization, embryo development and calving as supported by the favorable results of field fertility study. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {early diagnosis of pregnancy is important in livestock production, but there is no reliable technology used for pregnancy diagnosis within the first three weeks after insemination. During early pregnancy, the expression of interferon-stimulating genes (isgs) in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) is significantly increased. However, due to different strains, detection sample types, detection methods, threshold value, etc. the specific effectiveness of early pregnancy diagnosis using ISGs is worth further study. The purpose of this study was to test interferon-stimulated protein 15 (ISG15), 2'–5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) and radical s-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2) for early pregnancy diagnosis in dairy cows. The expression of ISG15, OAS1, and RSAD2 in PBL of pregnant and non-pregnant heifers on days 0, 14, 18, 21 and 28 after artificial insemination (AI) was detected by fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sensitivity and specificity of the pregnancy diagnosis was analyzed using expression of these three genes separately or in combination by receiver operating characteristic curve. The combination with the highest accuracy used probe primers and duplex fluorescence quantitative PCR. The single quantitative PCR results showed that expression of ISG15, OAS1 and RSAD2 on day 18 after AI was significantly higher in pregnant than in non-pregnant cows. When these three genes were used separately, or in combination, for early pregnancy diagnosis, the sensitivity for the RSAD2 gene was 100%, and the combination of ISG15 with RSAD2 was 94.7%. The duplex quantitative pcr showed that, although the sensitivity of ISG15 alone was 100%, its specificity was only 88.2% (cut-off value 1.402). The sensitivity of RSAD2 alone was 89.5%, and the specificity was 88.2%; however, when the two genes were used in combination, the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic cut-off value were consistent with the results of single quantitative PCR. These results indicated that a duplex quantitative PCR assay system for early pregnancy diagnosis in cows using ISG15 and RSAD2 was established. Simultaneous detection of expression of ISG15 and RSAD2 by duplex quantitative PCR can effectively improve the diagnostic accuracy for dairy cows. © 2019 Sciendo. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A Council of Europe Ordinance of 2000 obliged government structures of various levels to protect and care for cultural landscapes designated as human-inhabited territory, which characteristics express the mutual long-term influence of natural and anthropogenic factors. The concern is caused by the fact that since the second half of the 20th century, with the growth of mechanization, automation, and chemilization, the cultural landscapes of both the lowland and mountain regions have undergone particularly strong changes. The Alpine mountain region is considered as a benchmark in which the traditional economic activity in mountain areas, with its regional differences, keeps on co-existing with the current rapid development of technology, innovations and the increasing influence of external capital. However, the problems inherent in all the mountainous regions of Europe (desertion of rural settlements and outflow of population, declining role of agriculture and increasing role of tourism) are also characteristic of the Alpine region. The article deals with the territory of the northern, marginal part of the Alps, belonging to Germany - the Bavarian Alps. The Bavarian Alps occupy only 1.7% of the Germany territory but for Bavaria, this Alpine area is closely linked to its identity. In Alpine Bavaria, traditions, dialects, folklore are being preserved. The farmers land plots here are bigger than in other parts of the Alps, as well as the number of livestock. Population outflow in the Bavarian Alps is less than in some provinces of the Italian or French Alps. The Bavarian Alps is an area of developed, highly specialized and high-tech meat and dairy farming. But at the same time it is an area of sophisticated mass tourism - both, winter and summer. There are practically no original natural landscapes in the Bavarian Alps, since with the arrival of Bayovars, from about the 9th century, agricultural development of the territory began, and by the Middle Ages all suitable areas had been developed. Thus, all existing landscapes are cultural landscapes, the result of natural development and human impact. The cultural landscape of Bavaria, attractive for tourists and so important for the preservation of the natural balance, is supported primarily by farmers. Therefore, the main task is to prevent the desolation of mountain regions, the preservation of rural settlements and the rural way of life. Factors contributing to the preservation of the cultural landscape could be divided into external (political or legislative) and "internal". The external factors include: government subsidies of various levels (starting from the Council of Europe) to farmers; land law protecting the integrity of agricultural land; community rights to land and property management; building codes and regulations that preserve the architectural integrity of rural settlements. The “internal” factors in support of the Bavarian cultural landscape are hidden in the very system of rural life. These are traditions, customs, dialects. Traditions are worked out for centuries, passed down from generation to generation: housekeeping skills, crafts, customs, ceremonies, cuisine, etc. Traditions in Bavaria are very strong, as are the dialects. These factors unite people, create a connection with the place of residence with nature which is reflected in the cultural landscape. © 2019 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

Our results from the reported studies show water management is the highest sub-vertical (28.08%) followed by crop management (14.60%) then smart farming (10.11%). From the data collection, livestock management and irrigation management resulted in the same percentage (5.61%). In regard to sensor data collection, the highest result was for the measurement of environmental temperature (24.87%) and environmental humidity (19.79%). There are also some other sensor data regarding soil moisture (15.73%) and soil pH (7.61%). Research indicates that of the technologies used in IoT application development, Wi-Fi is the most frequently used (30.27%) followed by mobile technology (21.10%). As per our review of the research, we can conclude that the agricultural sector (76.1%) is researched considerably more than compared to the farming sector (23.8%). This study should be used as a reference for members of the agricultural industry to improve and develop the use of IoT to enhance agricultural production efficiencies. This study also provides recommendations for future research to include IoT systems' scalability, heterogeneity aspects, IoT system architecture, data analysis methods, size or scale of the observed land or agricultural domain, IoT security and threat solutions/protocols, operational technology, data storage, cloud platform, and power supplies. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI) with cryopreserved semen has a pivotal role in wider dissemination of germplasm of elite livestock and also for conservation of various endangered species. Cryopreservation allows storage of semen for a prolonged period of time and facilitates greater exchange of genetic material among distant populations. Cryopreservation, however, leads to certain deleterious effects on sperm including premature induction of the acrosome reaction, reduced sperm motility and viability, and impaired sperm DNA integrity and fertility. During cooling procedures, membrane phase transitions take place, which result in micro-domain formation from aggregation of lipids, leading to impaired functions of the sperm membrane, and gap formation between gel and fluid domains. Cyclodextrins are produced by enzymatic degradation of starch and possess a unique feature, that when added alone to sperm cyclodextrins facilitate the removal of cholesterol from the membrane. When preloaded with cholesterol, however, cyclodextrins stimulate the insertion of cholesterol into the sperm membrane due to presence of a hydrophobic core in addition to an outer hydrophilic face. Treating sperm of various species with cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin improves the quality of sperm during cryopreservation. It is still not clearly known how cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin functions at sperm cells to enhance the survival during cryopreservation. The present review, therefore, highlights possible mechanisms of cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin action on sperm during cryopreservation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Computer vision applications in livestock are appealing since they enable measurement of traits of interest without the need to directly interact with the animals. This allows the possibility of multiple measurements of traits of interest with minimal animal stress. In the current study, an automated computer vision system was devised and evaluated for extraction of features of interest, as body measurements and shape descriptors, and prediction of body weight in pigs. From the 655 pigs that had data collected 580 had more than 5 frames recorded and were used for development of the predictive models. The cross-validation for the models developed with data from nursery and finishing pigs presented an R 2 ranging from 0.86 (random selected image) to 0.94 (median of images truncated on the third quartile), whereas with the dataset without nursery pigs, the R 2 estimates ranged from 0.70 (random selected image) to 0.84 (median of images truncated on the third quartile). However, overall the mean absolute error was lower for the models fitted without data on nursery animals. From the body measures extracted from the image, body volume, area, and length were the most informative for prediction of body weight. The inclusion of the remaining body measurements (width and heights) or shape descriptors to the model promoted significant improvement of the predictions, whereas the further inclusion of sex and line effects were not significant. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The fundamental role for poultry farmers to be successful in their activities is to precisely increase, decrease, or maintain, in a short time span, factors that determine poultry growth, such as humidity, temperature, amount of feed ration, ventilation, and others. Although there are modern automatic control technologies supporting these aspects, systems are architected to react to environmental conditions based on predefined programmed control rules, without considering knowledge readings from historical data and, most importantly, the human specialist's reasoning. In practice, when control actions diverge from the specialist's opinion, signals of the automatic controller are immediately intercepted (via the system interface) to recalibrate them for a different control rule to be applied based on human perception. As the set of parameters tends to be large and they are frequently combined, whereas human perception tends to be limited, this intervention of automatic control tends to be an error-prone decision-making option. In this paper, we demonstrate that action plans for poultry management can be derived by systematically collecting data from the production environment. A sensor network is used to register poultry management data, which are then preprocessed using machine-learning techniques. To validate the obtained results, we compare them against action plans generated by a human specialist and baseline results. Analysis suggest that action plans derived from the proposed model follow, with acceptable accuracy, the control actions that should be taken by the controller when considering a knowledge-based perception that absorbs expert reasoning and best practices guidelines. The benefits of the proposed approach are discussed regarding economic factors such as average broiler weight and feed conversion ratio. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of estrus resynchronization (RE) after the first Timed Artificial Insemination (TAI) protocol on reproductive efficiency of suckled Bos taurus beef cows (n = 1052; Angus and Brangus) subjected to two different breeding season (BS) in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. In experiment 1, cows were maintained in native pasture on conventional BS (spring-summer), and in experiment 2, cows were maintained in a grazing area cultivated in an integrated crop-livestock system on modified BS (autumn -winter). Experiment 1 cows (n = 92) were randomly distributed in two reproductive managements: 1) TAI at the first day of the BS (Day 0), followed by natural service (NS) on day 10 until the end of the BS (TAI + NS; n = 45) or, 2) TAI on day 0, followed by RE 22 days after the first TAI and then followed by NS on day 42 until the end of the BS (TAI + RE22 + NS; n = 47). Experiment 2 cows (n = 960) were subjected to one of four reproductive managements: 1) only NS for 90 days of the BS (NS; n = 266); 2) TAI on day 0, followed by NS on day 10 until the end of the BS (TAI + NS; n = 200); 3) TAI on day 0, followed by RE 22 days after the first TAI and then followed by NS on day 42 until the end of the BS (TAI + RE22 + NS; n = 249) or, 4) TAI on day 0, followed by RE 30 days after the first TAI and then followed by NS on day 50 until the end of the BS (TAI + RE30 + NS; n = 245). In experiment 1, conception rate after first TAI was similar for treatments TAI + NS (42%, 19/45) and TAI + RE22 + NS (48%, 23/47; P = 0.4107). Total pregnancy rates at day 60 of the BS were 55.6% and 66.6% for TAI + NS and TAI + RE22 + NS, respectively (P = 0.006). In experiment 2, only 3% of the females submitted to NS were pregnant 30 days after the onset of BS, a lower rate compared to other groups (TAI + NS = 40%; TAI + RE22 + NS = 39.8%; TAI + RE30 + NS = 40%; P < 0.001). At 70 days of the BS, the groups TAI + RE22 + NS and TAI + RE30 + NS obtained greater pregnancy rate (66.3% and 69.4%, respectively) than other groups (NS = 16.9%; TAI + NS = 48%; P < 0.001). Pregnancy rate at the end of BS was greater in RE groups (TAI + RE22 + NS = 81.5%; TAI + RE30 + NS = 83.7%) than the NS (45.1%) or TAI + NS (71%). In conclusion, resynchronization increases pregnancy rate per AI (P/AI) and reproductive efficiency of suckled Bos taurus beef cows during spring-summer or autumn-winter breeding season in natural pasture or cultivated pasture, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Diet manipulation and genetic selection are two important mitigation strategies for reducing enteric methane (CH4) emissions from ruminant livestock. The aim of this study was to assess whether the diurnal pattern of CH4 emissions from individual dairy cows changes over time when cows are fed on diets varying in forage composition. Emissions of CH4 from 36 cows were measured during milking in an automatic (robotic) milking station in three consecutive feeding periods, for a total of 84 days. In Periods 1 and 2, the 36 cows were fed a high-forage partial mixed ration (PMR) containing 75% forage, with either a high grass silage or high maize silage content. In Period 3, cows were fed a commercial PMR containing 69% forage. Cows were offered PMR ad libitum plus concentrates during milking and CH4 emitted by individual cows was sampled during 8662 milkings. A linear mixed model was used to assess differences among cows, feeding periods and time of day. Considerable variation was observed among cows in daily mean and diurnal patterns of CH4 emissions. On average, cows produced less CH4 when fed on the commercial PMR in feeding Period 3 than when the same cows were fed on high-forage diets in feeding Periods 1 and 2. The average diurnal pattern for CH4 emissions did not significantly change between feeding periods and as lactation progressed. Emissions of CH4 were positively associated with dry matter (DM) intake and forage DM intake. It is concluded that if the management of feed allocation remains constant then the diurnal pattern of CH4 emissions from dairy cows will not necessarily alter over time. A change in diet composition may bring about an increase or decrease in absolute emissions over a 24-h period without significantly changing the diurnal pattern unless management of feed allocation changes. These findings are important for CH4 monitoring techniques that involve taking measurements over short periods within a day rather than complete 24-h observations. © The Animal Consortium 2018.},

To develop a methodology for remote assessment of pasture fertility, we used the technological capabilities of using unmanned aerial vehicles and satellite service, which allows us to study the dynamics of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) of various pasture plots in the Stavropol Territory of the Russian Federation. The analysis of literary sources shows that the main problems associated with the complex automation of forecasting processes for complex objects are not technical, but methodological in nature and are caused by the lack of a theoretical base that should form the basis for creating the corresponding model and algorithmic support. A comparison of the results of a prognostic assessment of the nutritional value of fodder plants obtained from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, space services with actual nutritional values obtained from studies of the zoochemical composition of feeds showed a high degree of correlation. The UAV capabilities were recognized as promising for assessing the ethological characteristics of the Manych merino sheep, which allows to optimize the acquisition of groups of animals consolidated by forage activity. The article considers the issues of assessing the nutritional value of pasture feed and the vegetation index when raising sheep of the Jalgin merino breed in the conditions of the steppe regions of the Stavropol Territory.

The food product must contain substances and components that are necessary for the human body for normal metabolism. At the moment there are many ways of raw meat processing. Especially one of the popular meat product is a sausage that is a meat product, with or without casing, consisting of minced meat. Monitoring of the processing procedure conduction as well as product quality is an important task. It is established that the analysis of sausages digital images in the RGB system makes it possible to obtain correlation dependencies between the values of parameters in individual channels-R, G, or B and the most important standard indicators of the quality of meat products, such as pH and the ratio of water and dry matter, which allows us to build an automated quality control system for finished meat products. © 2019 SPIE.},

	abstract = {In consequence of increasing workloads and the pressure to rationalize the workload in combination with increasing quality requirements of consumers, German dairy farms often invest in automation of single production processes. However, these automatic mechatronic systems are limited in their potential. As the more and more intelligent systems are not able to communicate among themselves. In this context, the approach of a cyber-physical system leads to new possibilities of product and process quality. The connection of all/several mechatronic subsystems causes to a more flexible production process which can adjust and optimise the production regarding external influences to the system. This results in an reduction of workload, automatic documentation and traceability of the product during the production process. Risks arise from the system itself. Hence, an appropriate user interface is necessary to control the system. For this, the farmer must be able to define boundaries in which the system can run on its own and where human authorisation is necessary. For the future the approach of a cyber-physical production system for dairy farms will be expandable to energy management or infield robotic. © 2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

	abstract = {The potential relationships between Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) concentrations and fertility were investigated by examining pregnancy rates and early pregnancy loss in different age groups of cows. Holstein heifers (17.35 ± 1.35 months, n = 20), young cows (3.25 ± 1.02 years, n = 20), and old cows (6.7 ± 0.80 years, n = 20) were synchronised and time fixed inseminated. A single blood sample per animal was taken during oestrus just before artificial insemination (AI), (Day 0) for the AMH analysis. The highest plasma AMH concentrations were determined in the heifer group (149.01 ± 12.62 pg/ml, P < 0.001) in the study. The AMH concentrations and conception rates decreased with age. The Day-0-AMH concentrations were higher in the pregnant animals at Day 20 after AI than in the non-pregnant animals (P < 0.05) in each group. The mean Day-0-AMH concentrations in the pregnant animals at Day 60 after AI was higher (P < 0.001) than the AMH concentrations in those with a detected pregnancy loss between D20 and D60, and also in those with a pregnancy loss and not being pregnant by Day 20 considered together. When each group was assessed on its own, based on the pregnancy results of Day 60, the Day-0-AMH concentrations were found to be significantly higher in the pregnant heifers than in the non-pregnant heifers and heifers with a pregnancy loss (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the AMH analysis might provide valuable information on the reproductive efficiency of the animals in a herd. © 2019 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Unpalatable plants reportedly serve as a biodiversity refuge. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate how unpalatable plants impact vegetation composition in alpine ecosystems. In the present study we investigated alpine meadows at four sites in four different prefectures on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of Qinghai Province, China. The study sites included meadows grazed by livestock (AO) and others in the vicinity colonised by the unpalatable grass, Achnatherum inebrians (AI), which the livestock avoided. The results showed: (1) palatable graminoid species were significantly different in the two groups: AO plots were dominated by Kobresia spp. (sedges), whereas AI plots were dominated by Poa pratensis and Elymus nutans (grasses) (2) graminoid diversity was significantly higher in AI than in AO plots (3) grasses had significantly more seeds in AI than in AO plots. We suggest a three-step process for the invasion of A. inebrians into overgrazed alpine meadows in Northern China. First, soil is disturbed by rodents. Second, disturbed soil is invaded by A. inebrians. Third, the A. inebrians community is colonised by palatable grasses such as Elymus, Poa, Leymus and Stipa spp. © 2019 Australian Rangeland Society.},

	abstract = {Losses during the farrowing phase significantly affect both farm economics and animal welfare regarding to piglet mortality. Thus, warranting the need for animal supervision. The automation of monitoring of animals during this period is crucial to Precision Livestock Farming and the general animal welfare. The objective of this study was to develop an automated farrowing predictor by classification of sow nest-building behaviors based on non-intrusive, stress-free, contactless infrared distance sensors. Experiments were performed at Jurong Research farm of Nanjing Agricultural University, using a herd of 125 large white Landrace sows. Time-series data were collected from 14 crated sows, 10 were assigned to the training dataset and four as a testing dataset for final model validation. Cluster evaluation was performed by distance-based and density-based methods to determine the optimum groupings within the dataset. Subtractive clustering was then used to develop an optimized Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System model to correlate the infrared distance sensor data to the sow nest-building behavior. The cluster analysis gave a result of nesting and non-nesting behaviors as the optimum grouping within the dataset. The developed optimized model had an RMSE of 0.1516 for training dataset and 0.1173 for checking dataset. The classification of nest-building behavior by the model achieved an average accuracy of 89.00%, a specificity of 90.59%, a precision of 83.82%, and a sensitivity of 89.25%. The developed system can thus be used as an automatic monitoring system in Precision Livestock Farming for both animal and stockman welfare. © 2018, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {The study of reproductive physiology in domestic ruminants has progressed from the whole animal to the molecular level in an amazingly short period of time. The volume of information on this subject is enormous; therefore, we have focused on domestic ruminants, with an emphasis on cattle. To date, artificial insemination (AI) is perhaps the most powerful technique that reproductive physiologists and geneticists have provided the livestock industry for genetic improvement. Early efforts to establish AI as a tool were initiated in Russia around 1899 and since that time major advances in methods of semen collection, evaluation of male fertility, cryopreservation of sperm, sex-sorted semen, and estrous cycle control have occurred. The preceding advances not only led to the widespread use of AI, but also contributed to our fundamental understanding of ovulation control, timing of insemination, gamete biology, and cryopreservation. In regards to anestrus, our understanding of the concept of neuroendocrine control of the pituitary gland and the role of steroid feedback led to the Gonadostat Theory, which proposes that onset of puberty is due to a decrease in the negative feedback of gonadal steroids over time. Subsequent studies in prepuberal and postpartum sheep and cattle established that a short luteal phase frequently precedes the first normal length cycle that is accompanied by estrous expression. This observation led to the common practice of treating prepuberal heifers and anestrous postpartum cows with a short-term progestin treatment (e.g., Controlled Internal Drug Release) to induce normal estrous cycles. In domestic ruminants, fertilization rate is high (85% to 95%); however, significant embryonic mortality before or around the time of maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) reduces the pregnancy rate to a single breeding. Significant effort has been directed at determining the time of MRP, the signal for MRP, as well as elucidating the physiological, cellular, and molecular dialogue between the conceptus and uterine environment. Advancements have now led us to the ability to edit the genome to alleviate disease and possibly improve production traits. In summary, major advancements in our understanding of reproductive biology have stemmed from efforts to establish the AI and embryo transfer technique and reduce the negative impact of anestrus and embryonic mortality in domestic ruminants. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Among such innovations in the reproduction area, post-cervical or intrauterine artificial insemination (PCAI) has emerged as a new approach in artificial insemination (AI). PCAI is gradually replacing traditional cervical insemination (CAI), particularly in countries with intensive pig production industries. This type of insemination, which deposits the semen in the body of the uterus (as opposed to traditional cervical deposition), is increasingly used in the field due to its simplicity and the numerous advantages that it provides at production level (e.g. reduced number of sperm, less time required to perform insemination and faster genetic improvement) and, consequently, from an economic point of view. In addition, since its inception, PCAI has been combined with other reproductive biotechnologies, such as the use of frozen-thawed sperm, fixed-time AI or sperm-mediated gene transfer. However, despite its wide acceptance and application, new approaches for increasing the efficiency of PCAI are constantly being sought, such as the adjustment and standardization in sperm numbers, the conservation of the PCAI semen dose, its association with other biotechnologies (sex-sorted sperm) or its efficacy in young (nulliparous and primiparous) females. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

The method used was an experiment with sequencing analysis based on RAPD results with the marker OPA-19 with five replications. The sequencing results were descriptive analysis using SPSS V. 23 with unpaired t-test on the two ILEG populations. The results showed that the ILEG from NS had a very significantly higher number of repeated G-nucleotides (P < 0.01) than ILEG from AI. While the data of repeated GGG, GGGG, GGGGG and GGGGGG were not used for unpaired t-tested because it did not pass normality test. Descriptively repeated GGG, GGGG, GGGGG and GGGGG on ILEG from NS results were higher than AI. Particularly in repeated G-nucleotides (GGGG, GGGGG and GGGGGG), in ILEG from NS results were still found to be 100% in all sequencing samples, but in ILEG from AI results showed decreased percentages of 60%, 40% and 0%.

	abstract = {Signal feeding - an automated operant conditioning for acoustic signals that indicate the individual availability of feed - has been shown to be an effective cognitive environmental enrichment for group housed pigs. Moreover, it reduced queuing behaviour and the number of severe lesions in a dynamic large group in a previous study. However, the previous studies trained the pigs within small groups of not more than 12 sows and used an electronic feeding station which could identify pigs at the entrance. In addition, they did not report the effect of the training itself on lesion incidence. The present study was conducted to validate the earlier results at a conventional livestock farm. Here, the training was performed within a group of up to 35 sows and with a feeding station which identified sows at the trough only. The training of the whole group required, in total, 180 days. First results show that signal feeding works under common practical conditions but might lead to more skin lesions during the period of transitioning from conventional electronic feeding to signal feeding. The associated higher level of aggressive encounters had however no significant effect on the rearing performance. Continued observations of further gestations will show whether the consolidation of the conditioning leads to a general reduction of aggressive encounters especially at group mixing. This might result in an easier integration of younger sows, which could be associated with an increased conception rate or improvement of the breeding results and would make signal feeding cost-effective in practical applications. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

	abstract = {Differential diagnosis of diseases that share common clinical signs typically requires the performance of multiple independent diagnostic tests to confirm diagnosis. Diagnostic tests that can detect and discriminate between multiple differential pathogens in a single reaction may expedite, reduce costs, and streamline the diagnostic testing workflow. Livestock haemorrhagic diseases like classical swine fever (CSF), African swine fever (ASF), and vesicular diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), vesicular stomatitis (VS), and swine vesicular disease (SVD) can have an enormous impact on the livestock industry and economy of countries that were previously free of the diseases. Thus, rapid diagnosis of these diseases is critical for disease control. Here, we describe the development and initial laboratory validation of a novel fully automated user-developed assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of multiple viruses of veterinary importance in a single reaction with minimal user-intervention. The user only performs sample loading, placement of consumables and reagents, selection and initiation of assay while all other processes (i.e., nucleic acid extraction, multiplex RT-PCR, reverse dot blot detection and result reporting) are performed fully automated. The current assay has a turn-around time of approximately 6 hr and can simultaneously process up to 24 samples. The automated assay accurately and specifically detected 37 laboratory amplified strains of the five target viruses, including all seven serotypes of FMD virus, three genotypes of CSF virus, and two serotypes of VS virus. The assay also detected targeted viruses in a variety of clinical samples collected from infected animals, such as oral fluid, oral swab, nasal swab, whole blood, serum, as well as tonsil, spleen, kidney, and ileum. No cross-reactivity was observed with 15 nontarget viruses that affect livestock and samples from clinically healthy animals. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated and integrated assay for simultaneous detection of multiple high consequence veterinary pathogens. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

	abstract = {Companies need to perform systematic diagnoses to prospect the market positioning strategies and remain competitive in the current industrial scenario. Each of the company’s sectors must be analyzed because they all lead to business success. Based on the understanding that diagnosis is essential for maintaining the competitiveness of a company, this document aims to propose improvements in processes and activities of storage and shipping stage of a meat processing company. A SWOT analysis is used to classify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats and to correlate these factors. The information for the diagnosis was collected initially on literature and then through on-site visits and interviews with employees from the meat processing company. The results indicated that the storage and shipping stage of the analyzed company is positioned on the second matrix quadrant, called Maintenance. Based on the achieved results, a correlational study between strengths and opportunities has been carried out, converting threats into opportunities, using strengths to eliminate weaknesses, and also suggestions of strategies to the storage and shipping stage are presented. Among the proposals, the training of workers, activity automation and improvement of product packaging can be highlighted. © 2019 Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

	abstract = {Livestock vocalisations have been shown to contain information related to animal welfare and behaviour. Automated sound detection has the potential to facilitate a continuous acoustic monitoring system, for use in a range Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) applications. There are few examples of automated livestock vocalisation classification algorithms, and we have found none capable of being easily adapted and applied to different species’ vocalisations. In this work, a multi-purpose livestock vocalisation classification algorithm is presented, utilising audio-specific feature extraction techniques, and machine learning models. To test the multi-purpose nature of the algorithm, three separate data sets were created targeting livestock-related vocalisations, namely sheep, cattle, and Maremma sheepdogs. Audio data was extracted from continuous recordings conducted on-site at three different operational farming enterprises, reflecting the conditions of real deployment. A comparison of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and Discrete Wavelet Transform-based (DWT) features was conducted. Classification was determined using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. High accuracy was achieved for all data sets (sheep: 99.29%, cattle: 95.78%, dogs: 99.67%). Classification performance alone was insufficient to determine the most suitable feature extraction method for each data set. Computational timing results revealed the DWT-based features to be markedly faster to produce (14.81 – 15.38% decrease in execution time). The results indicate the development of a highly accurate livestock vocalisation classification algorithm, which forms the foundation for an automated livestock vocalisation detection system. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Spray-dried plasma (SDP) proteins are recognized as safe, high-quality feed ingredients for livestock due to their immune modulatory components, including immunoglobulins, bioactive peptides and growth factors. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of feeding a SDP product during the first 200 d of lactation on milk production and reproduction performance in dairy cows. Nine hundred ninety-eight Holstein cows, 260 d pregnant, were enrolled in a completely randomized design. Before calving, cows were fed a late gestation ration containing blood meal (BM; 13.3 g/kg of DM; Control; n = 503) or SDP (16.0 g/kg of DM; 250 g SDP/d; n = 495) replacing BM on N basis. After calving, Control cows were randomly distributed in two pens and fed a lactation ration containing 15.6 g/kg BM (DM basis). Cows on SDP were randomly distributed in 2 pens and fed a lactation ration that contained 18.3 g/kg SDP (DM basis. 400 g/d of SDP), which replaced BM. Cows were milked three times per day and milk production and composition were monitored monthly at one milking. First service consisted of a timed AI protocol applied to all cows that were > 44–50 DIM. Following AI, cows were examined daily for return to estrus or for confirmation of pregnancy by rectal palpation at 35–41 and 70–76 d after AI. At 72–78 DIM, cows not pregnant were enrolled into an intrauterine progesterone program. Cows fed SDP had greater milk yield (P < 0.01; 16.8 vs 16.4 kg/milking) and milk fat (P < 0.05; 35.5 vs 34.7 g/kg), but there were no differences in milk protein or in milk SCC between Control and SDP cows. Milk yield improvement in SDP cows was evident during the second month of lactation and onwards. No differences in pregnancy rate, overall conception rate, days at which pregnancy occurred or body condition score were observed between treatments. In conclusion, supplementation with SDP in dairy cows slightly increased milk yield and milk fat content without affecting reproductive parameters. © 2019},

The present study examined for the first time whether a robot scraper usually applied in dairy farming is usable in sow housings for cleaning the slatted floors and improving hygiene and thus animal welfare. For evaluating the suitability of the robot scraper with regard to the cleaning performance (polluted surface area and occluded slots), the whole housing area was divided into score-squares, which were individually scored at defined intervals. Selected excrement quantities removed by the robot were weighed. In order to assess the animals’ interactions with the robot scraper, their behaviour towards the device was observed. Although the faeces of pigs had a firmer consistency than bovine excrement, excrement quantities of up to 1.4 kg m2 were almost completely removed. Even 6 h after the cleaning its e ect was still visible. Dry-cleaning led faster to nonslip surfaces for the sows than wet-cleaning. Within half an hour of observation, up to 8.2 of 120 sows were occupied with the robot scraper, but without harming it. The use of robot scrapers in pig housings is recommended, although slight technical modifications should be made to the robot scraper. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The importance of computers has become very popular, the interaction between man and machine is indispensable every day. People's need and desire to communicate with machines naturally led to the evolution of natural language processing. While progress is being made in this area, it is likely that voice interaction systems will replace most portable and digital devices such as keyboards, card readers, etc. This paper presents the main paradigms for speaker recognition, being one of the most important and needed biometric feature and it also focuses on the use of these biometric technology for interactive voice response system for agriculture assistance to farmers. Agriculture has been the primary occupation of human being. Generally farmers do not have the scientific information or competence to find out the cause and solution of any situation that could appear as diseases of their animals or even crops, behavioral features etc. They could have difficulties with understanding machine language or even typing. To facilitate the farmer’s access to information regarding the solution of a specific kind of livestock or crops matter this paper proposes a concept of an interactive voice response system through their mobile phones; a model with voice response in many languages. This model will be advantageous in following conditions: For people with disabilities, people with few PC knowledge or even those who are very busy. Biometric recognition or, simply, biometrics refers to the automatic recognition of individuals based on their physiological and/or behavioral characteristics. The voice is a physiological feature (each person has a different vocal tract), but the recognition of a speaker is mainly based on the study of how it speaks, usually classified as behavioral. Speech recognition is a multi-application domain: Security of any kind, telecommunication, daily activities, and now it could be used in agricultural situation. Speech Recognition summarizes a variety of issues such as recognizing isolated words, identifying speakers based on their voice tag, recognizing phonemes, etc. The utility of identifying people based on their voice is growing with the development of automation and telecommunication, and, also regarding the new-entry telephone line applications, the need to recognize the speaker has become more pressing. Speech recognition has a particularly high applicability due to the fact that this method is non-intrusive, universally accepted, with acceptable accuracy, and speech samples are easily sampled either by phone or by microphone. © SGEM 2019.},

	abstract = {There is evidence that phases of the moon affect wild animal behaviors including reproduction. There is, however, little evidence of moon phase effects on domestic livestock reproduction. This study investigated the effects of moon phase and climatic variables on boar ejaculate traits. Records of 4149 semen collections from boars of nine different breeds at one boar stud were used. The response variables were volume of ejaculate, concentration of sperm in the ejaculate, and number of doses obtained per ejaculate. Moon phase, greatest daily temperature (T), least daily T, average daily relative humidity (RH), temperature-humidity index (THI), season and the interaction of moon phase with season were analyzed at the day of collection and 45 days prior to date of collection as a proxy of initiation of spermatogenesis. For both dates analyzed season and the interaction of season with moon had significant effects (P < 0.05) on the volume of the ejaculate. Moon phase had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on volume of ejaculate at the day of collection. Sperm concentration was affected (P < 0.05) by the interaction of moon phase with season, high and low temperature, THI, RH and breed. Season had an effect (P < 0.01) on concentration of sperm at the initiation of spermatogenesis. For doses that could be used for AI that were obtained/ejaculate, there were effects of moon phase, season, the interaction between season and moon phase and breed (P < 0.05) at collection day and at the initiation of spermatogenesis. There was an interaction (P < 0.0001) between season and moon phase for volume of ejaculate, sperm concentration and number of doses obtained per ejaculate at date of collection and at day of initiation of spermatogenesis. The significant interaction of season and moon phase on boar semen traits suggests that to maximize productivity of modern swine production systems determining a collection schedule in some seasons relative to moon phase may be advantageous. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are widely used to treat fertility issues in humans and for the production of embryos in mammalian livestock. The use of these techniques, however, is not without consequence as they are often associated with inauspicious pre- and postnatal outcomes including premature birth, intrauterine growth restriction and increased incidence of epigenetic disorders in human and large offspring syndrome in cattle. Here, global DNA methylation profiles in the trophectoderm and embryonic discs of in vitro produced (IVP), superovulation-derived (SOV) and unstimulated, synchronised control day 17 bovine conceptuses (herein referred to as AI) were interrogated using the EmbryoGENE DNA Methylation Array (EDMA). Pyrosequencing was used to validate four loci identified as differentially methylated on the array and to assess the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of six imprinted genes in these conceptuses. The impact of embryo-production induced DNA methylation aberrations was determined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, shedding light on the potential functional consequences of these differences. Results: Of the total number of differentially methylated loci identified (3140) 77.3 and 22.7% were attributable to SOV and IVP, respectively. Differential methylation was most prominent at intragenic sequences within the trophectoderm of IVP and SOV-derived conceptuses, almost a third (30.8%) of the differentially methylated loci mapped to intragenic regions. Very few differentially methylated loci were detected in embryonic discs (ED); 0.16 and 4.9% of the differentially methylated loci were located in the ED of SOV-derived and IVP conceptuses, respectively. The overall effects of SOV and IVP on the direction of methylation changes were associated with increased methylation; 70.6% of the differentially methylated loci in SOV-derived conceptuses and 57.9% of the loci in IVP-derived conceptuses were more methylated compared to AI-conceptuses. Ontology analysis of probes associated with intragenic sequences suggests enrichment for terms associated with cancer, cell morphology and growth. Conclusion: By examining (1) the effects of superovulation and (2) the effects of an in vitro system (oocyte maturation, fertilisation and embryo culture) we have identified that the assisted reproduction process of superovulation alone has the largest impact on the DNA methylome of subsequent embryos. © 2018 The Author(s).},

Using the video capture device to obtain the 360°torso information of the cow, the cow's video is obtained by frame acquisition to obtain the cow's torso image information, and the residual learning deconvolution neural network is used to denoise the 21600 cow images. Randomly selects pictures to define the training set and testing set as the ratio of 9:1 and selects the InceptionV3 network to train the main network of the individual identification of the cows. Through the cross-validation of the training set and the test set, the top_1 recognition accuracy rate of the single image can reach 87%, and the top_3 recognition accuracy rate is 93%.Through the improvement of InceptionV3 neural network, the top_1 recognition accuracy of multiple images can reach 92%, and the recognition accuracy of top_3 is 95%. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

In this review, the authors introduce the technology for sperm sexing by flow cytometry, the efforts at commercializing sexed semen in Japan, and recent field data on artificial insemination of the cattle with sexed semen. Methods: In the procedures of the flow cytometric method, X-chromosome-bearing sperm and Y-chromosome-bearing sperm were fluorescently stained, separated from each other by analyzing the difference in the DNA content, and cryopreserved. The authors surveyed the conception rates after AI with these sperm and sex ratios of the offspring with the cooperation from livestock associations, AI technicians, and farmers. Main findings (Results): Although AI with sexed semen was associated with lower conception rates in comparison with AI with conventional semen, the accuracy of sex selection using AI with sexed semen was beyond >90%. Conclusion: Sexed semen produced by flow cytometry has the potential to produce offspring of the preferred sex with high accuracy and reliability. Thus, it is expected that sexed semen is used for AI more frequently in the farms. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {For livestock farmers, the diversity of tasks, the freedom to act as he/she likes, the contact with nature and animals explain the attraction, often passionate, for an activity, in constant mutation due to technical and sociological evolutions. Gains in efficiency and productivity are diminished by the increasing size of the structures and the workload remains important. Nowadays livestock farmers seek to better balance work and private life, and to preserve their health, which implies decent working conditions, more daily serenity and a recognition of their role by society. Automation and robotization demand to acquire technological mastery, but allow time-saving and bring flexibility in organizing days. Wage-earning and feminization are developing: they modify farmers’ job and could contribute more to the renewal of the generations. Environmental and animal welfare concerns lead to systems known to be more agro-ecological, but requiring new learning and complex transitions. The head-on questionings to livestock farming are offset by local initiatives demonstrating the social utility of farms which provide jobs, territorial identity and healthy products. The diversity of livestock models in the territories, complementarity between them and other agricultural and non-agricultural activities, as well as the renewal of advisory tools are part of perspectives to arouse the desire to become a farmer.

	abstract = {The present study was conducted to explore the farmer’s perception regarding constraints faced in adoption of dairy farming practices in Sindh province of Pakistan. The data were collected from 133 project dairy farmers of Pakistan Dairy Development Company (PDDC) and 133 non-PDDC dairy farmers. The constraints were measured with three-point continuum scale. The survey results revealed that on overall basis, technical, financial, and physical constraints, viz., poor conception rate of artificial insemination (AI) in buffaloes, high price of concentrates, high cost of treatment, etc. received higher scores for both groups (PDDC and non-PDDC farmers). In contrast, overall mean scores were relatively low for knowledge (lack of knowledge about proper time of AI/natural service, heat detection, disease control, scientific housing, clean milk production), skills (lack of technical skills regarding fodder conservation and preparation of balanced ration), and lack of financial support by government, etc.; recorded as severe constraints with higher scores for non-PDDC farmers as compared to PDDC farmers. These results indicate that augmenting extension services through PDDC on training and technical know-how is essential to overcome constraints of adoption by farmers who never adopted the practices, while technical, financial, and physical support to farmers are critical for a wider scale, sustained adoption of livestock practices. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The demand for food will increase to an unprecedented level over the next 30 years owing to human population expansion, thus necessitating an evolution that improves the efficiency of livestock production. Genetic gain to improve production traits of domestic animal populations is most effectively achieved via selective use of gametes from animals deemed to be elite, and this principle has been the basis of selective breeding strategies employed by humans for thousands of years. In modern-day animal agriculture, artificial insemination (AI) has been the staple of selective breeding programs, but it has inherent limitations for applications in beef cattle and pig production systems. In this review, we discuss the potential and current state of development for a concept termed Surrogate Sires as a next-generation breeding tool in livestock production. The scheme capitalizes on the capacity of spermatogonial stem cells to regenerate sperm production after isolation from donor testicular tissue and transfer into the testes of a recipient male that lacks endogenous germline, thereby allowing the surrogate male to produce offspring with the donor haplotype via natural mating. This concept provides an effective selective breeding tool to achieve genetic gain that is conducive for livestock production systems in which AI is difficult to implement.

At the moment, this is implemented through the application of scoring systems by human experts. The automation of this process would be extremely helpful for veterinarians to enable a systematic examination of all slaughtered livestock, positively influencing herd management. However, such systems are not yet available, mainly because of a critical lack of annotated data. In this work we: (i) introduce a large scale dataset to enable the development and benchmarking of these systems, featuring more than 4000 high-resolution swine carcass images annotated by domain experts with pixel-level segmentation; (ii) exploit part of this annotation to train a deep learning model in the task of pleural lesion scoring. In this setting, we propose a segmentation-guided framework which stacks together a fully convolutional neural network performing semantic segmentation with a rule-based classifier integrating a-priori veterinary knowledge in the process. Thorough experimental analysis against state-of-the-art baselines proves our method to be superior both in terms of accuracy and in terms of model interpretability.

	abstract = {Critical to fertilization success, sperm capacitation within the female oviductal sperm reservoir endows mammalian spermatozoa with hyperactivated motility and capacity to fertilize. An elaborate cascade of signaling events during capacitation guides the redistribution of sperm plasma membrane seminolipid and cholesterol, Ca-influx and increases tyrosine phosphorylation to promote hyperactivated motility. Such events result in the remodeling of the sperm acrosome, increased fluidity and fusability of the plasma membrane, shedding of surface-adsorbed seminal plasma proteins that glue sperm heads to the oviductal epithelium and ultimately the release of hyperactivated spermatozoa from the oviductal sperm reservoir. Discovered recently, the capacitation-induced sperm zinc ion efflux and resultant zinc signatures are reflective of sperm capacitation status and fertilizing ability, inspiring the retrospection of zinc ion functions in the physiology and fertility of boar sperm and that of other species. This review also highlights the merit of the domestic boar as a biomedical model for spermatology and fertilization research. Relevant to the quest for better fertility management in the livestock industries, the benefits of zinc ion supplementation through nutrition and direct addition to extended semen are discussed in the context of artificial insemination (AI).

	abstract = {Farm Management Information Systems and Wireless Sensor Networks can help German dairy farmers cope with rising complexity, documentation and animal health requirements. However, review and expert interviews with German farmers show that available solutions mostly are standalone systems. They lack compatibility with other technologies like already existing Information Systems and automation technology in dairy stables (e.g. climate-control, energy management or robotic milking). Farmers and researchers wish for a solution that integrates sensor systems, the control of actuators and existing information systems on dairy farms into one central information- and control-system. Moreover, an option to provide customized user interfaces to different stakeholders is required. This research shows, that a digital broker model as middleware offers manufacturer-independent opportunities to integrate existing information systems, wide arrays of different sensors and data transmission technologies. It further takes care of data management issues. The example of the TUM dairy research farm is shown, where a broker model is being implemented for research and teaching. Results show, that a broker model is a powerful tool to overcome most compatibility and connectivity issues and provides the desired solutions. However special aspects regarding connectivity must be taken into consideration on a dairy farm. Different transmission technologies are needed for different tasks, as a dairy farm offers very diverse conditions for IoT technology implementation. Customized user interfaces can be provided. Research is necessary regarding regulatory issues, and manufacturers need to be won over by the benefits of these systems, so that an integration of their technologies is facilitated. © 2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

To develop a methodology for distant assessment of pastureland fertility, technological capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and satellite service were used. It allows studying the dynamics of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) of various pasture plots in the Stavropol Territory of the Russian Federation. The analysis of literary sources shows that the main problems associated with the complex automation of complex objects forecasting processes are not technical, but methodological in nature and are caused by the lack of a theoretical framework that should be used as the basis for creating the appropriate model-algorithmic support. Comparison of the results of the prognostic evaluation of the nutritional value of forage plants obtained from UAV images and space services with the actual nutritional values obtained from the study of the zoochemical composition of feed showed a high degree of correlation in the range of 0.65-0.75.

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI) is the single most important assisted reproductive technique devised to facilitate the genetic improvement of livestock. In the swine industry, it has broadly replaced natural service over the last number of decades which has been made possible by the high pregnancy rates and litter sizes obtainable with semen extended, up to, and sometimes beyond 5 d. Central to achieving good reproductive performance is the ability of boar studs to monitor semen quality, the basis of which has long been the assessment of sperm motility by subjective and, more recently, by more objective computerised systems. In this review, the literature on the relationship between sperm motility and kinematic parameters and field fertility is summarised. We discuss how this relationship is dependent on factors such as the viscosity of the media and the use of standard operating procedures. Emerging evidence is discussed regarding the importance of sperm rheotaxis and thigmotaxis as long-distance sperm guidance mechanisms, which enable motile functional spermatozoa to avoid the backflow of fluid, mucus and semen from the sow's uterus in the hours post AI, facilitating the establishment of sperm reservoirs in the oviducts. The literature on the use of microfluidics in studying sperm rheotaxis in vitro is also summarised, and we discuss how these systems, when combined with techniques such as lensless microscopy, have the potential to offer more physiological assessments of the swimming patterns of boar spermatozoa. Finally, possible future avenues of further investigation are proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Mosquito and tick feeding activity represent a key threat for humans, livestock, pets and wildlife worldwide. Rearing these vectors in laboratory conditions is extremely important to investigate basic facets of their biology, vector competence, new control strategies, as well as mechanisms of pesticide resistance. However, the use of animals or humans to provide blood for hematophagous arthropod feeding poses a strict limit to these researches, due to the accidental transmission of diseases, ethical problems concerning animal welfare, as well as expensive and time-consuming animal rearing procedures. The use of devices to artificially feed arthropod vectors can importantly leverage progresses in parasitology and entomology. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge about artificial feeding of mosquitoes and ticks, focusing on key concepts and case studies about the design and fabrication of blood feeding devices. From a technical standpoint, the literature analyzed here showed little standardization of materials used for fabricating membrane interfaces, as well as in the strategy used to heat the “biomimetic host”. In addition, a lack of uniform methods to design an architecture merging complex and realistic cues with an easy-to-assemble approach have been found. Some commercial products are available, but they are quite expensive, thus hard to reach for many laboratories, especially in developing countries. An important challenge for future research is represented by the introduction of automation and bioinspired engineered solutions in these devices, improving the effectiveness of blood-feeding systems by increasing their host-mimicking features. Automation can reduce labor costs and provide interesting solutions – in line with the 3R principle “reduce, replace and refine” – aimed to minimize the employ of experimental animals in research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The aim of this review is to compare the performance of different reproductive programs using natural service, estrus synchronization treatment before natural service (timed natural breeding (TNB)), artificial insemination (AI) following estrus detection and timed artificial insemination (TAI) in beef herds. It is well known that after parturition the beef cow undergoes a period of anestrous, when they do not exhibit estrus, eliminating the opportunity to become pregnant in the early postpartum by natural mating or by AI after detection of estrus. Hormonal stimulation is already a consistent and well-proven strategy used to overcome postpartum anestrus in beef herds. Basically, hormones that normally are produced during the estrous cycle of the cow can be administered in physiological doses to induce cyclicity and to precisely synchronize follicular growth, estrus and ovulation. Furthermore, two options of mating may be used after hormonal stimulation: natural service (i.e. utilization of bull service after synchronization, referred to as TNB) and TAI. These strategies improve the reproductive efficiency of the herds compared with natural service without estrus induction or synchronization. After the first synchronized service, the most common strategy adopted to get non-pregnant cows pregnant soon is the introduction of clean-up bulls until the end of the breeding season. However, methods to resynchronize non-pregnant cows after the first service are already well established and offer a potential tool to reduce the time for subsequent inseminations. Thus, the use of these technologies enable to eliminate the use of bulls by using resynchronization programs (i.e. two, three or four sequential TAI procedures). The dissemination of efficient reproductive procedures, such as TNB, TAI and Resynch programs, either isolated or in combination, enables the production of a greater quantity (obtaining increased pregnancy rates early in the breeding season) and quality (maximization of the use of AI with superior genetic sires) of beef calves. These technologies can contribute to improve the production efficiency, and consequently, improve livestock profitability. © The Animal Consortium 2018.},

	abstract = {A foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak during 2010 affected the entire country of South Korea and approximately 3.4 million swine and bovine mortalities were disposed of at approximately 4800 on-farm burial sites for a few months following the first outbreak. Furthermore, outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) have struck Korea consistently since 2014. Public concern regarding the deterioration of the surrounding environment has been raised aiming at the enormous infected animal carcass burials. On behalf of the Ministry of Environment (ME) of the Korean government, we conducted groundwater monitoring at approximately 3000 wells around the burial sites for 7 years from 2011 to 2017. The baseline groundwater already had enriched levels of nitrogen and chloride compounds masking the influence of leachate with the pre-existing anthropogenic contamination. Based on the trend analysis, most monitoring wells had no significant trends in NO3-N and Cl implying that an abrupt degradation in water quality was not expected across the country. Increasing proportions of total coliform detection in the groundwater of the majority of provinces will cause potential damage to human health around the carcass burial sites. Wells showing frequent upward and downward trends near the carcass burial pits were targeted for principal component analysis (PCA) and the results showed that NH4-N, TOC, Cl, and K could be indicators distinguishing the sole impacts of animal leachate on the groundwater. Analyses of the nationwide monitoring data indicated possibly delayed and prolonged impacts of the widespread burials of livestock mortalities on the groundwater environment. The finding provides realistic insight regarding how to manage the mass burial of livestock mortalities to protect groundwater resources. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Large scale phenotyping of animal behaviour traits is time consuming and has led to increased demand for technologies that can automate these procedures. Automated tracking of animals has been successful in controlled laboratory settings but tracking animals in large groups in highly variable farm settings presents challenges. The aim of this review was to provide a systematic overview of the advances that have occurred in automated, high throughput image detection of swine behavioural traits with welfare and production implications. Peer-reviewed publications written in English were reviewed systematically following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. After identification, screening, and assessment for eligibility, 63 publications met these specifications and were included for qualitative synthesis. Data collected from the papers included camera specifications, housing conditions, group size, algorithm details, procedures and results. Most studies utilised standard digital cameras (n = 54) for video collection, with increasing 3-D monitoring in papers published in 2014 and beyond. Papers included pigs in production stages ranging from recently weaned piglets to mature breeding sows. Behaviours recorded included activity level, area occupancy, aggression, gait scores, resource use, and posture, among others. Our review revealed many overlaps in methods applied to analysing behaviour, and most studies started from scratch instead of building upon previous work. Training and validation sample sizes were generally small (mean = 10) and testing took place in relatively controlled environments. To advance our ability to automatically phenotype behaviour, future research should build upon existing knowledge and validate technology under commercial settings. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

	abstract = {A comprehensive survey was developed and mailed to 3000 Wisconsin dairy (1000), livestock (500) and crop (1500) producers in early 2018. The survey was designed to evaluate internet and other digital technology use; digital technology applications deployed on farms; internet and mobile service satisfaction; barriers to technology adoption; and, use differences across groups based on demographic factors that included farm income, farm size, age, education level and gender. After eliminating undelivered/returned mailings, the survey had a 43% response rate (n = 1021). Internet access and use levels were strongly and positively associated with gender (women), farm income, farm size (hectares and numbers of animals) and education level. Higher levels of income, education, and acreage, females and ages under 55 were associated with significantly higher levels of internet access. For both mobile and home/office computer access, cost was an area with higher dissatisfaction along with slow download speed during heavy use periods. Weather and market information were categories of information most often accessed, while farm program and educational information were the categories least accessed. The most significant barriers to adoption of digital technology on respondents’ farms included data privacy and security concerns, software and system compatibility, and understanding how to use and derive value from acquired data. The survey examined areas of digital application adoption including finance and marketing tools and apps, precision planting and harvesting, sensor applications (soil, livestock, structures/environment), and robotic milking equipment and found adoption to increase with acreage, income, youth, and for females. In addition, a case study of two Wisconsin producers quantified and characterized all data generated on their farms in 2017. These producers stored 51 MB per hectare and 73 MB per milking head in 2017. These data provide insight into rural broadband needs that would allow agricultural producers to make data-driven decisions and foster innovation. © 2019},

	abstract = {Consumption of animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs in first-world countries has leveled off, but it is rising precipitously in developing countries. Agriculture will have to increase its output to meet demand, opening the door to increased automation and technological innovation; intensified, sustainable farming; and precision livestock farming (PLF) applications. Early indicators of medical problems, which use sensors to alert cattle farmers early concerning individual animals that need special care, are proliferating. Wearable technologies dominate the market. In less-value-per-animal systems like sheep, goat, pig, poultry, and fish, one sensor, like a camera or robot per herd/flock/school, rather than one sensor per animal, will become common. PLF sensors generate huge amounts of data, and many actors benefit from PLF data. No standards currently exist for sharing sensor-generated data, limiting the use of commercial sensors. Technologies providing accurate data can enhance a well-managed farm. Development of methods to turn the data into actionable solutions is critical. Copyright © 2019 by Annual Reviews.

	abstract = {Background: Ticks have a negative effect on dairy and beef cattle production systems around the world, with the concomitant risk they represent for the transmission of some important infectious diseases. Colombian cattle breeds are distributed across different agroecological regions and are exposed to different environmental challenges. In humid and warmer climates such as those from the tropics, tick burden and heat stress are important factors that can compromise livestock performance. The aim of this study was to characterize tick burden in four Colombian cattle breeds and evaluate the relationship between heat stress and tick burden in Bos taurus cattle under tropical conditions. Tick counting was conducted in 1332 cattle from Romosinuano (ROMO), Costeño con Cuernos (CCC), San Martinero (SM) and Blanco Orejinegro (BON) breeds, located in the Caribbean, Orinoquia and Andean regions. Vital signs and environmental variables were taken to calculate an adaptability index (AI) and a temperature humidity index (THI). An AI < 2 indicates maximum adaptability while an AI ≥ 2 indicates a state of lower adaptability. In beef cattle, productivity starts to be affected by heat stress when environmental conditions allow an estimation of a THI > 75. Results: Results showed a differing distribution of ticks on the body of individuals that varied according to the agroecological region. There was a significant effect of breed, sex, family, age and live weight on cattle tick burden. The lowest tick burden was observed in the ROMO breed (12.8 ± 2.6), while the highest tick burden was observed in CCC (31.8 ± 2.3), which were located in the same agroecological region. SM and ROMO animals with an AI > 2 had a higher tick burden than their counterparts that had an AI < 2. Conclusions: Cattle breed, sex, age and live weight affect the tick burden in Bos taurus Colombian cattle breeds. The tick burden is higher in cattle with lower adaptability to heat stress. Moreover, it decreases as heat stress levels increase in a tropical environment. The interaction between tick burden and environmental heat stress can be affected by characteristics of the agroecological region itself, the breed and the genetic resistance of the individual tick, as well as the thermal adaptability of cattle. © 2019 The Author(s).},

This leads to a national loss due to infectious proliferation as well as an economic loss due to productivity and income decrease in livestock farmers, which has a serious adverse effect on the development of livestock industry. Representative examples of such livestock diseases include foot-and-mouth disease and AI virus. A major source of infection of foot-and-mouth disease and AI spread is virus transmission by livestock transportation vehicles. To solve this problem, an I-beacon-based distribution management system was designed to prevent the spread of livestock diseases caused by livestock transportation vehicles. I-beacon’s Proximity UUID, Major and Minor identifier data are used to determine whether the GPS and Bluetooth communication technology is used by identifying the indoor/outdoor location of the farm, and the location information data of the transportation vehicle is identified, Provides real-time monitoring service by visualizing location information and distribution route data by grasping information and distribution route. When the system design is used to detect livestock diseases, it is possible to prepare for the proliferation of livestock diseases by investigating the spread of livestock diseases based on the distribution route record, focusing on the point where the first livestock disease occurs. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The objective of the study reported in this Research Communication was to investigate the association of polymorphisms in the insulin-like growth factor receptor 2 (IGF2R) gene with milk traits in 283 Polish Holstein-Friesian (PHF) cows from the IGAB PAS farm in Jastrzeȩbiec. IGF2R regulates the availability of biologically active IGF2 which is considered as a genetic marker for milk or meat production in farm animals. Two novel genetic polymorphisms were identified in the bovine IGF2R gene: a polymorphic TG-repeat in intron 23 (g.72389 (TG)15-67), and a g.72479 G > A SNP RFLP-StyI in exon 24. The following milk traits were investigated: milk yield, protein and fat yield, SCC and lactose content. To determine the influence of the IGF2R STR and SNP genotypes on the milk traits, we used the AI-REML (average information restricted maximum likelihood) method with repeatability, multi-trait animal model based on test-day information using DMU package. Statistical analysis revealed that the G/A genotype (P ≤ 0·01) was associated with milk and protein yield, lactose content and somatic cell count (SCC) in Polish HF cows. TGn (29/22, 28/29, 28/22, 28/28) genotypes were associated with high values for milk, (28/22, 28/23) with protein and fat yield, (25/20) with lactose content, and (29/33, 28/28) with low SCC. We suggest that the IGF2R gene polymorphisms could be useful genetic markers for dairy production traits in cattle. Copyright © Hannah Dairy Research Foundation 2018.},

	abstract = {Biogas engineering based on anaerobic digestion is an important engineering way for the resource utilization of agricultural wastes (i.e. straws, livestock and poultry manure) and plays an important role in promoting the circulative agriculture. How to achieve the effective resource utilization of the digested biogas residue is important for the operation of biogas engineering. Composting is a crucial way to accomplish the harmless, reduced and resourceful utilization of biogas residues and widely applied to the treatment of manure and wastewater in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Reactor composting, with the advantages of shorter composting period, smaller area, easier automation control and lower secondary pollution, has been widely used for the waste treatment in large-scale CAFOs. However, the technique of reactor composting still needs to be improved, for its remaining defects that may cause insufficient aeration, difficult water removal and low degree of intensification of composting stuff, which restricts its application for biogas residue composting. In this study, a pilot aerobic fermentation rotary reactor with the volume of 500 L for the integrated biogas residue composting was designed to meet the demand of rapid composting treatment of biogas residue. The aerobic fermentation rotary reactor for biogas residue was mainly composed of raw material pretreatment, aerobic fermentation, biological deodorization and reactor control unit. The rotary copying board was improved, including pushing material copy board, parallel copy board, and blocking material copy board. The ventilation system was improved by “frequency conversion air supply-controllable heating-fan-shaped cloth gas-sectional aeration” technologies. An automatic control system for the designed reactor has been developed; the biogas residue pretreatment and biological deodorization technology were integrated in the designed reactor. Based on the organic matter degradation model and the moisture removal model, the ventilation rate and frequency were optimized. The optimal process parameters of the aerobic fermentation rotary reactor were obtained, the rotary filling rate was 0.6.The rotary rotation speed was 3 r/min. The aeration frequency was aeration 12 min, interval 18 min. The aeration rates during the warming-up, thermophilic and cooling periods were 112, 114 and 110 L/min, respectively. The performance tests were carried out with biogas residue, pig manure and straw as raw materials for 15 days of composting, the ratio of biogas residue, pig manure and straw was 8.75:6.25:4, the moisture content of the mixed materials was 55%-60%, C/N was 20-25. The results showed that the reactor has the function of real-time monitoring the temperature and oxygen data of different gradients. The temperature of composting piles higher than 50℃ could last for 7 days during the composting process. The germination index of composted pile was more than 80% after 15 days of composting. The moisture content of composted pile was less than 30% after 15 days of composting. This study could provide technique and equipment support for the rapid composting of biogas residue. ©2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {The domestication of farm animals starting 12,000-15,000 years ago in the Middle East was a seminal achievement in human development that laid the foundation of agriculture as it is known today. Initially, domesticated animals were selected according to phenotype and/or specific traits adapted to a local climate and production system. The science-based breeding systems used today originated with the introduction of statistical methods in the sixteenth century that made possible a quantitative approach to selective breeding for specific targeted traits. Now, with the availability of accurate and reliable DNA analysis, this quantitative approach has been extended to DNA-based breeding concepts that allow a more cost-effective but still quantitative determination of a genomic breeding value (GBV) for individual animals. The impact of these developments was dramatically enhanced with the introduction of reproductive technologies extending the genetic influence of superior individual animals. The first of these was artificial insemination (AI) that started to be developed in the late nineteenth century. Industry uptake of AI was initially slow but increased dramatically following the development of semen extenders, the reduction of venereal disease risk by inclusion of antibiotics, and most significantly the development of effective freezing and cryostorage procedures in the mid-twentieth century. AI is now used in most livestock breeding enterprises, most notably by the dairy industry where more than 90% of dairy cattle are produced through AI in countries with modern breeding structures Embryo transfer (ET), a technology that for the first time allowed exploitation of the female genetic pool, was made possible through the major advances in the biological sciences in the later part of the twentieth century. Advances in understanding of the reproductive cycle and its hormonal control, the availability of purified gonadotropins, and improved cell and embryo culture procedures all played significant roles. ET is now being increasingly implemented in top end breeding endeavors, particularly in the top 1-2% of a given cattle population. But its real impact is yet to come as ET is the key enabler in the introduction of the next generation of enhanced breeding technologies. ET has already played a key role in advances such as in vitro production of embryos, sexing, cloning, and transgenesis. With the birth of "Dolly," the cloned sheep, in 1996, a century-old dogma in biology, which inferred that a differentiated cell cannot be reprogrammed into a pluripotent stage, was abolished. Today, through recent developments in molecular cell biology, available protocols are efficient enough to allow commercial application of somatic cloning in the major farm animal species. This will not only further enhance the rate of genetic gain in herds and flocks but through the recent advent of precise genome editing tools allow the production of novel germlines for agricultural and biomedical purposes through the capacity to genetically modify farm animals with targeted modifications with high efficiency. This paves the way for the introduction of the precision breeding concepts needed to respond to future challenges in animal breeding, stemming from matching the demands of ongoing hyperbolic human population growth to the limited availability of arable land and environmental constraints. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to identify the major electricity and water-consuming components of a pasture-based automatic milking (AM) system and to establish the daily and seasonal consumption trends. Electricity and water meters were installed on 7 seasonal calving pasture-based AM farms across Ireland. Electricity-consuming processes and equipment that were metered for consumption included milk cooling components, air compressors, AM unit(s), auxiliary water heaters, water pumps, lights, sockets, automatic manure scrapers, and so on. On-farm direct water-consuming processes and equipment were metered and included AM unit(s), auxiliary water heaters, tubular coolers, wash-down water pumps, livestock drinking water supply, and miscellaneous water taps. Data were collected and analyzed for the 12-mo period of 2015. The average AM farm examined had 114 cows, milking with 1.85 robots, performing a total of 105 milkings/AM unit per day. Total electricity consumption and costs were 62.6 Wh/L of milk produced and 0.91 cents/L, respectively. Milking (vacuum and milk pumping, within-AM unit water heating) had the largest electrical consumption at 33%, followed by air compressing (26%), milk cooling (18%), auxiliary water heating (8%), water pumping (4%), and other electricity-consuming processes (11%). Electricity costs followed a similar trend to that of consumption, with the milking process and water pumping accounting for the highest and lowest cost, respectively. The pattern of daily electricity consumption was similar across the lactation periods, with peak consumption occurring at 0100, 0800, and between 1300 and 1600 h. The trends in seasonal electricity consumption followed the seasonal milk production curve. Total water consumption was 3.7 L of water/L of milk produced. Water consumption associated with the dairy herd at the milking shed represented 42% of total water consumed on the farm. Daily water consumption trends indicated consumption to be lowest in the early morning period (0300–0600 h), followed by spikes in consumption between 1100 and 1400 h. Seasonal water trends followed the seasonal milk production curve, except for the month of May, when water consumption was reduced due to above-average rainfall. This study provides a useful insight into the consumption of electricity and water on a pasture-based AM farms, while also facilitating the development of future strategies and technologies likely to increase the sustainability of AM systems. © 2018 American Dairy Science Association},

	abstract = {The worlwide ascending demographic development automatically determined a growing demand of meat and other derived products from animals raised in livestock farms. Therefore, taking into consideration the fact that, every year, the need for animals food has increased, every compound feed factory (CFF) aims to obtain diversified formulas of final products, depending on the breed and the age of the animals that will be fed. To resist on the competitive market with this profile of production, all compound feeds factories must be equipped with functional installations, as modern as possible, which ensures the possibility of automated and computerised check of ongoing activities, but also a strict surveillance of parameters imposed by European Union's norms concerning environmental protection. In this article, experimental measurements were made throughout technological flows of obtaining several types of compound feeds used in Broiler chickens feeding, in different stages of raising them. The working points were placed in the area of the steam-powered boiler and of the molds for obtaining final granular shaped products, because here are used hot streams of steam, which being necessary for homogenization and sterilization of the granules. The values obtained from these thermotechnical measurements have the role to demonstrate the reliability of functional installations being used, but also the rigurous respect of pollution norms. © SGEM2018.},

The proposed ontology model is designed and tested in the Protege 4.3. An experimental scenario is explained for the detailed understandings of the ontology model. Findings: Each livestock has different health and needs special care on diets according to the age, weight, health and phase of the livestock. It is not certain that all types of cow require the same amount of nutrients, as they vary in age, growth and health evidently. Therefore, the ontology model is used to define the relationship between the classes, which are built to automatically detect the accurate amount of nutrient supply for the cow, with the help of knowledge base. Improvements: Livestock ontology model for diet management is a reassuring model in the automation of feed management. In other words, the model is capable of deciding the nutrition requirement for the cow based on the basic information without any human intervention.},

	abstract = {Antagonistic relationship between milk yield and reproduction is reported in several livestock species. This study aimed to investigate whether genetic merit for milk production in dairy sheep affects responses to superovulation, embryo yield and quality. A total of 21 cross-bred Sarda x Lacaune ewes homogeneous for age, parity and stage of lactation were included. The ewes were stratified as high-producing or low-producing based on their genetic merit for milk production estimated by a pentatrait repeatability animal model. Oestrus was synchronized using an intravaginal progesterone pessary inserted on Day 0 and removed on Day 14. Superovulatory treatment consisted of 350 I.U. of porcine FSH administered in eight decreasing intramuscular doses every 12 hr with a total dose of 10 ml of solution starting 12 days after insertion of sponges. Laparoscopic artificial insemination (AI) was performed 48 hr after pessary removal. Surgical embryo recovery was performed at Day 8 after pessary removal. Correlation between breeding value for milk production and the number of corpora lutea (CL) was significantly different from zero (−0.49). High-producing ewes had a lower number of CL than low-producing counterparts (7.6 ± 2.50 vs 12.1 ± 5.16 respectively; p <.02). Furthermore, there was a tendency for high-producing ewes to yield fewer embryos than low-producing females (5.3 ± 3.46 vs 9.18 ± 5.11; p =.09). No differences were observed between ewes in both genetic groups with regard to the number of embryos of grades 1, 2 and 3. To our knowledge, this is the first report highlighting an antagonism between genetic merit for milk production and the ability to produce embryos in sheep. These results deserve to be considered in sheep breeding programmes. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

	abstract = {Until now, the development of precision livestock farming has been largely based on data acquisition automation. The future challenge is to develop interpretative tools to capitalize on high-throughput raw data and to generate benchmarks for phenotypic traits. We developed a dynamic model of female BW that converts BW time series into a vector of biologically meaningful parameters. The model is based on a first submodel that split a female’s weight into elementary mass changes related to biological functions: growth (G component), reserves balance (R component), uterine load (U component), and maternal investment (M component). These elementary weight components are linked to the second submodel, which represents the litter developmental stages (oocyte, fetus, neonate, and juvenile) that drive elementary components of dam weight over each reproductive cycle. The so-called GRUM model is based on ordinary differential equations and laws of mass action. Input data are BW measures, age, and litter weight at birth for each parturition. Outputs of the fitting procedure are a vector of parameters related to each GRUM component and indexed by reproductive cycle. We illustrated the potential application of the model with a case study including growth and successive lactations (n = 202) from 45 dairy goats from the Alpine (n = 27) and Saanen (n = 18) breeds. The fitting procedure converged for all individuals, including goats that went through extended lactations. We analyzed the fitted parameters to quantify breed and parity effects over 4 reproductive cycles. We found significant differences between breeds regarding gestation components (fetal growth and reserves balance). We also found significant differences among reproductive cycles for reserves balance. Although these findings are based on a small sample, they illustrate how use the model can be to adapt herd management and implement grouping strategies to account for individual variability. © 2017 American Society of Animal Science.

	abstract = {Automated tracking of the location of individual chickens is becoming more common in behavioural research. This technology has several advantages including gathering large amounts of data and monitoring of individual animals as opposed to flocks. To ensure the quality of the research the transmitters or tags attached to the bird as part of the automated positioning system should not have any effect on bird behaviour, welfare and production. Tag-related effects may lead to unreliable results which cannot be extrapolated to untagged birds. Therefore, we tested the effects of wearing a backpack containing a tag as part of an ultra-wideband system for automated position monitoring. The chickens’ behaviour, leg health, cleanliness and body weight gain were studied. Sixty slow-growing broiler chickens (Sasso XL451) were housed in groups of 10 birds. Per pen, five birds were fitted with a 36-g tag (TAG) in a backpack from day 35–70 and the other five were identified using colour markings (CON). Behavioural observations from video recordings of TAG and CON chickens were performed twice daily (15-min periods) every other day. Birds were weighed on day 35 and 70, and on day 70 foot pad and hock dermatitis, gait, and cleanliness were scored. TAG birds walked less than CON birds in week 6, but this difference was absent from week 7 onwards. CON birds pecked more at TAG birds than other TAG birds did in week 6, probably due to the novelty of the tags, whereas the TAG birds could investigate their own tag instead of pecking at other birds’ tags. No significant differences were observed for scores for foot pad and hock dermatitis, gait and cleanliness scores or weight gain between TAG and CON birds. These results indicate that the backpacks with tags had only minor, non-persistent effects on slow-growing broiler chickens’ behaviour. The effects of colour-marking on behaviours observed in this study are likely to be small. The results indicate that the tags can be used for further studies in which these behaviours, welfare measures and production parameters play an important role. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Africa has a shortage of animal products but increasing demand because of population growth, urbanisation and changing consumer patterns. Attempts to boost livestock production through the use of breeding technologies such as artificial insemination (AI) have been failing in many countries because costs have escalated and success rates have been relatively low. One example is Kenya, a country with a relatively large number of cows and a dairy industry model relevant to neighbouring countries. There, an innovative dairy marketing approach (farmer-owned collective marketing systems called dairy hubs) has been implemented to enhance access to dairy markets and dairy-related services, including breeding services such as AI. So far, the rate of participation in these dairy hubs has been slow and mixed. In order to understand this phenomenon better and to inform dairy-related development activities by the Kenyan government, we investigated which characteristics of AI services, offered through the dairy hubs, farmers prefer. To do so, we applied a choice experiment (CE), a non-market valuation technique, which allowed us to identify farmers' preferences for desired characteristics should more dairy hubs be installed in the future. This is the first study to use a CE to evaluate breeding services in Kenya and the results can complement findings of studies of breeding objectives and selection criteria. The results of the CE reveal that dairy farmers prefer to have AI services offered rather than having no service. Farmers prefer AI services to be available at dairy hubs rather than provided by private agents not affiliated to the hubs, to have follow-up services for pregnancy detections, and to use sexed semen rather than conventional semen. Farmers would further like some flexibility in payment systems which include input credit, and are willing to share the costs of any AI repeats that may need to occur. These results provide evidence of a positive attitude to AI services provided through the hubs, which could mean that AI uptake would improve if service characteristics are improved to match farmer preferences. The dairy hubs concept is currently in the implementation phase with most hubs at startup phase, hence understanding which AI service characteristics farmers prefer can inform the design of high-quality and cost-effective AI services in the future. © 2016 The Animal Consortium.},

	abstract = {Buffalo farming has made remarkable progress in productivity mainly because of controlled breeding with artificial insemination (AI) that has proved its worth in breed improvement and breeding managements across the livestock species. Artificial insemination is practiced very little in Europe and East Asian countries with coverage of only 5% buffaloes in Italy, 3.7% in Azerbaijan, 0.3% in Egypt, and 0.1% in Romania although in Bulgaria, 80% buffaloes in large cooperative state farms are subjected to AI. In Turkey, it began in 2002 near Hatay with Italian semen provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Network project. In India, where buffaloes are the most valuable livestock species, research on buffalo specific artificial breeding technologies and adoption of AI by buffalo owners are widely acknowledged. Resultantly, average milk yield of buffaloes in India increased from 3.4 kg in 1992 to 93 to 4.57 kg/day/buffalo in 2009 to 10. In the new millennium, mega projects such as the National Project for Cattle and Buffalo Breeding and the National Dairy Plan were initiated with focus on genetic upgradation of bovine and buffalo population through streamlining AI services and support system in the country. Artificial insemination started in India in the year 1939, and the frozen semen was introduced during late 1960s. During the year 2010 to 11, India produced 63 million bovine frozen semen straws including over one million buffalo semen straws through 49 semen stations. Artificial insemination services are provided through 71,341 AI stations clocking 52 million inseminations with overall conception rate of 35% in bovine and buffalo population. Research is being conducted for improved AI conception rates with synchronization programs and improved frozen-thawed semen quality, and success rates are at par with AI in cattle. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

However, conventional microarrays require extensive manual handling and multiple pieces of equipment for printing probes, hybridization, washing and signal detection. In this study, a reverse transcription (RT)–PCR with an accompanying novel automated microarray for simultaneous detection of eight viruses that affect cattle [vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 1 and type 2, bovine herpesvirus 1, bluetongue virus, malignant catarrhal fever virus, rinderpest virus (RPV) and parapox viruses] is described. The assay accurately identified a panel of 37 strains of the target viruses and identified a mixed infection. No non-specific reactions were observed with a panel of 23 non-target viruses associated with livestock. Vesicular stomatitis virus was detected as early as 2 days post-inoculation in oral swabs from experimentally infected animals. The limit of detection of the microarray assay was as low as 1 TCID50/ml for RPV. The novel microarray platform automates the entire post-PCR steps of the assay and integrates electrophoretic-driven capture probe printing in a single user-friendly instrument that allows array layout and assay configuration to be user-customized on-site. © 2016 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada},

	abstract = {In livestock breeding, the successful outcome is largely depending on the “periconception environment” which, in a narrow sense, refers to the genital tract, where gametogenesis and embryogenesis occur. During these early stages of development, gametes and embryos are known to be particularly sensitive to alterations in their microenvironment. However, as the microenvironment somehow reflects what is going on in the external world, we must widen our definition of “periconception environment” and refer to all events taking place around the time of conception, including metabolic state and health and nutrition of the dam. In modern dairy cows that have to manage an optimal reproductive performance with continued growth and high milk yield, the periconception period is particularly challenging. The metabolic priority for growth and lactation is known to generate adverse conditions hampering optimal ovarian function, oocyte maturation, and development of embryo/fetus. In addition, by using artificial reproductive technologies (ARTs), gametes and/or embryos of livestock are exposed to unnatural conditions outside the male and female genital tract. Artificial insemination, the most widely used technique, is currently yielding pregnancy rates similar to natural mating, and calves produced by AI are equally viable after natural mating. In contrast, other ART, such as multiple ovulation and embryo transfer, have been reported to induce changes in gene expression and DNA methylation patterns with potential consequences for development. Finally, the “periconceptional” environment has been shown to not only influence the successful establishment of pregnancy but also the long-term health and productivity of the offspring. Hence, the optimization of management around the time of conception might open doors to improve animal production and product quality. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

The aim of the present study was to capture key performance indicators related to AMS utilisation on commercial Australian AMS farms on a monthly basis, with the aim of understanding the current and potential system performance. Eight Australian AMS farms were monitored on a monthly basis for a 12-month period. The average number of milking events (milkings/robot.h) was calculated for every hour of the day, on a monthly basis for each of the participating farms. Data exported electronically also allowed the calculation of the number of current and potential extra (both average and maximum) milkings (milkings/robot.day), cows (cows/robot), yield (kg milk/robot.day) and milking time (h/robot.day) for every month on each farm. Despite a wide range in farm performance, the actual milkings (120 milkings/robot.day), cows (51 cows/robot), yield (1263 kg milk/robot.day) and milking time (13.63 h/robot.day) indicated that there is an opportunity to improve these parameters by a maximum of ∼60%. To achieve this would require the adoption of a variety of strategies that might be quite farm specific and would be reliant on optimisation of data relating to cow traffic and system utilisation that are relevant to automatic milking systems. © 2017 CSIRO.},

	abstract = {Footpad dermatitis and lameness are a major welfare concern in broiler chicken farming. In general, footpad lesions are linked to poor environmental conditions. Ulcers that arise from advanced lesions can negatively affect the gait of the birds, with effects on the animal welfare, including, in the worst cases, inability to reach the feed or water. In this study, the degree of footpad dermatitis and lameness was manually scored on four broiler farms across Europe, as part of an EU-wide welfare assessment programme (Welfare Quality® protocol). Assessment of animal welfare is typically based on manual scoring, which requires a lot of trained manpower/labour. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) can combine information technologies into on-line automated tools that can be used to control, monitor and model the behavior of animals and their biological response without stressing, disturbing or handling the animals. The association between the PLF and the Welfare Quality® protocol was investigated to assess whether animal welfare could be better ensured if they were closely monitored with state of the art technology that gives rapid feedback to the farmer. Thus, the aim of this study was to find the association between environmental predisposing factors, measured continuously (such as the indoor temperature and humidity) and leg problems, scored manually during the welfare assessment procedure, in order to find an automated prediction system to detect those lesions. Even if genetics is a heavy predisposing factor for leg disorders, environmental condition could trigger the presence of lesions. Indeed, immobility on litter of poor quality might cause footpad dermatitis affecting the gait of birds. The association between automated control of the environmental conditions and the welfare assessments could be the basis for the development of models and algorithms capable to automatically detect thresholds above which lesions are mostly probable. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

	abstract = {The objective of this review is to present, evaluate and discuss methods for reducing false alarms in sensor-based detection models developed for livestock production as described in the scientific literature. Papers included in this review are all peer-reviewed and present sensor-based detection models developed for modern livestock production with the purpose of optimizing animal health or managerial routines. The papers must present a performance for the model, but no criteria were specified for animal species or the condition sought to be detected. 34 papers published during the last 20 years (1995–2015) are presented in three groups according to their level of prioritization: “Sheer detection models” based on single-standing methods with or without inclusion of non-sensor-based information (19 papers), “Improved detection models” where the performance of the described models are sought to be improved through the combination of different methods (12 papers) and “Prioritizing models” where the models include a method of ranking or prioritizing alerts in order to reduce the number of false alarms (3 papers). Of the three methods that rank or prioritize alerts; Fuzzy Logic, Naive Bayesian Network (NBN) and Hidden phase-type Markov model, the NBN shows the greatest potential for future reduction of alerts from sensor-based detection models in livestock production. The included detection models are evaluated on three criteria; performance, time-window and similarity to determine whether they are suitable for implementation in modern livestock production herds. No model fulfills all three criteria and only three models meet the performance criterion. Reasons for this could be that both sensor technology and methods for developing the detection models have evolved over time. However, model performance is almost exclusively presented by the binary epidemiological terms Sensitivity (Se) and Specificity (Sp). It is suggested that future research focus on alternative approaches for the output of detection models, such as the prior probability or the risk of a condition occurring. Automatic monitoring and early warning systems offer an opportunity to observe certain aspects of animal health, welfare, and productivity more closely than traditionally accomplished through human observation, and the opportunities for improving animal welfare should continue to be a driving force throughout the field of precision livestock farming. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Premontane humid forests (pm-hf) are severely degraded from anthropogenic disturbance derived from agricultural and livestock. Given the loss of connectivity among forest patches, it is necessary to study how agroecosystems, especially because an important part of biodiversity would be present in these agroecosystems. Because there is a loss of connectivity throughout these fragmented landscapes, it is necessary to develop studies on the contribution of coffee agroecosystems to biodiversity. This study evaluated plant diversity and estimated the agricultural intensification index (AI) in two coffee agronomic management strategies and forests at La Meseta at Popayán, Cauca, Colombia between 1600 and 1700 m. Thirteen local variables related to plants, such as richness, coffee density, arboreal structure, were evaluated in 20 sampling sites: eight sun coffee, eight shaded coffee plantations and four reference forests. The study found that floristic diversity decreased in function of AI, where the variables related to the arboreal component were the most sensitive to the IA measurement of intensification change. Arboreal composition consisted mainly of pioneer species, which are relevant for conservation and regional restoration purposes. It is concluded that the AI, applied to these agroecosystems helps to measure the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. Shaded coffee and forest patches are sources of plant diversity, of habitat and landscape connectivity in the highly fragmented Andean coffee landscapes; the application of the intensification index in coffee crops may constitute a useful tool to examine hypotheses related to sustainability and conservation. © 2018, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

	abstract = {Female reproductive technologies such as multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) and juvenile in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer (JIVET) can produce multiple offspring per mating in sheep and cattle. In breeding programs this allows for higher female selection intensity and, in the case of JIVET, a reduction in generation interval, resulting in higher rates of genetic gain. Low selection accuracy of young females entering JIVET has often dissuaded producers from using this technology. However, genomic selection (GS) could increase selection accuracy of candidates at a younger age to help increase rates of genetic gain. This increase might vary for different traits in multiple trait breeding programs depending on genetic parameters and the practicality of recording, particularly for hard to measure traits. This study used both stochastic (animals) and deterministic (GS) simulation to evaluate the effect of reproductive technologies on the genetic gain for various traits in sheep breeding programs, both with and without GS. Optimal contribution selection was used to manage inbreeding and to optimally assign reproductive technologies to individual selection candidates. Two Australian sheep industry indexes were used- A terminal sire index that focussed on growth and carcass traits (the 'Lamb 2020' index) and a Merino index that focuses on wool traits, bodyweight, and reproduction (MP+). We observed that breeding programs using artificial insemination or natural mating (AI/N) + MOET, compared with AI/N alone, yielded an extra 39% and 27% genetic gain for terminal and Merino indexes without GS, respectively. However, the addition of JIVET to AI/N + MOET without GS only yielded an extra 1% genetic gain for terminal index and no extra gain in the Merino index. When GS was used in breeding programs, we observed AI/N + MOET + JIVET outperformed AI/N + MOET by 21% and 33% for terminal and Merino indexes, respectively. The implementation of GS increased genetic gain where reproductive technologies were used by 9-34% in Lamb 2020 and 37-98% in MP+. Individual trait response to selection varied in each breeding program. The combination of GS and reproductive technologies allowed for greater genetic gain in both indexes especially for hard to measure traits, but had limited effect on the traits that already had a large amount of early age records. © 2017 CSIRO.},

The pipeline of therapeutic compounds is limited and parasite resistance to the existing anthelmintic compounds is a global threat. We have developed an INVertebrate Automated Phenotyping Platform (INVAPP) for high-throughput, plate-based chemical screening, and an algorithm (Paragon) which allows screening for compounds that have an effect on motility and development of parasitic worms. We have validated its utility by determining the efficacy of a panel of known anthelmintics against model and parasitic nematodes: Caenorhabditis elegans, Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, and Trichuris muris. We then applied the system to screen the Pathogen Box chemical library in a blinded fashion and identified compounds already known to have anthelmintic or anti-parasitic activity, including tolfenpyrad, auranofin, and mebendazole; and 14 compounds previously undescribed as anthelmintics, including benzoxaborole and isoxazole chemotypes. This system offers an effective, high-throughput system for the discovery of novel anthelmintics. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {Early detection of post-calving health problems is critical for dairy operations. Separating sick cows from the herd is important, especially in robotic-milking dairy farms, where searching for a sick cow can disturb the other cows' routine. The objectives of this study were to develop and apply a behaviour- and performance-based health-detection model to post-calving cows in a robotic-milking dairy farm, with the aim of detecting sick cows based on available commercial sensors. The study was conducted in an Israeli robotic-milking dairy farm with 250 Israeli-Holstein cows. All cows were equipped with rumination- and neck-activity sensors. Milk yield, visits to the milking robot and BW were recorded in the milking robot. A decision-tree model was developed on a calibration data set (historical data of the 10 months before the study) and was validated on the new data set. The decision model generated a probability of being sick for each cow. The model was applied once a week just before the veterinarian performed the weekly routine post-calving health check. The veterinarian's diagnosis served as a binary reference for the model (healthy-sick). The overall accuracy of the model was 78%, with a specificity of 87% and a sensitivity of 69%, suggesting its practical value. © The Animal Consortium 2016.},

Here, we review the properties, biological roles and cellular mechanisms that are relevant to zinc function in the male reproductive system, survey available peer-reviewed data on nutritional zinc supplementation for fertility improvement in livestock animals and infertility therapy in men, and discuss the recently discovered signaling pathways involving zinc in sperm maturation and fertilization. Emphasis is on the zinc-interacting sperm proteome and its involvement in the regulation of sperm structure and function, from spermatogenesis and epididymal sperm maturation to sperm interactions with the female reproductive tract, capacitation, fertilization, and embryo development. Merits of dietary zinc supplementation and zinc inclusion into semen processing media are considered with livestock artificial insemination (AI) and human assisted reproductive therapy (ART) in mind. Collectively, the currently available data underline the importance of zinc ions for male fertility, which could be harnessed to improve human reproductive health and reproductive efficiency in agriculturally important livestock species. Further research will advance the field of sperm and fertilization biology, provide new research tools, and ultimately optimize semen processing procedures for human infertility therapy and livestock AI. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {Body condition scoring (BCS) is a farm-management tool for estimating dairy cows’ energy reserves. Today, BCS is performed manually by experts. This paper presents a 3-dimensional algorithm that provides a topographical understanding of the cow's body to estimate BCS. An automatic BCS system consisting of a Kinect camera (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) triggered by a passive infrared motion detector was designed and implemented. Image processing and regression algorithms were developed and included the following steps: (1) image restoration, the removal of noise; (2) object recognition and separation, identification and separation of the cows; (3) movie and image selection, selection of movies and frames that include the relevant data; (4) image rotation, alignment of the cow parallel to the x-axis; and (5) image cropping and normalization, removal of irrelevant data, setting the image size to 150 × 200 pixels, and normalizing image values. All steps were performed automatically, including image selection and classification. Fourteen individual features per cow, derived from the cows’ topography, were automatically extracted from the movies and from the farm's herd-management records. These features appear to be measurable in a commercial farm. Manual BCS was performed by a trained expert and compared with the output of the training set. A regression model was developed, correlating the features with the manual BCS references. Data were acquired for 4 d, resulting in a database of 422 movies of 101 cows. Movies containing cows’ back ends were automatically selected (389 movies). The data were divided into a training set of 81 cows and a test set of 20 cows; both sets included the identical full range of BCS classes. Accuracy tests gave a mean absolute error of 0.26, median absolute error of 0.19, and coefficient of determination of 0.75, with 100% correct classification within 1 step and 91% correct classification within a half step for BCS classes. Results indicated good repeatability, with all standard deviations under 0.33. The algorithm is independent of the background and requires 10 cows for training with approximately 30 movies of 4 s each. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association},

With this theoretical background, an attempt was made to study the adoption status of AI and also to identify factors affecting adoption of AI in India by both qualitative and quantitative methods from 360 dairy farmers in four states of North India. The adoption status of AI pointed out that majority of the respondents had adopted AI since more than 9 years, which was mostly partial in nature. Multinomial logit model depicted the Chi-square value of 113.97, indicating that the model was highly significant (p <.001). Two variables (‘distance to veterinary institution’ and ‘education’) significantly influenced the probability of partial and full adoption of AI. In case of full adoption, in addition to the above variables, ‘size of livestock holding’ and ‘scientific orientation’ also emerged as significant variables. Since majority of the dairy farmers were in partial adoption category, scientists have to analyse the problems of dairy farmers and find suitable solutions for higher diffusion and adoption at field conditions by participatory technology generation and transfer approach in India. © 2016 The author(s).},

	abstract = {The body size of the livestock is an important indicator for breeding and animal production, however, the traditional measurement of body size of the livestock is a hard manual operation and it is inaccurate, expensive and time-consuming. In the field of computer vision measurement, the location of the pig body size measurement points is an essential work. To solve the automatic extraction of pig body size measurement points based on point clouds, a method of automatic extraction of pig body size measurement points was developed based on rotation normalization approach. In order to acquire the measurement points of the livestock, several processing steps were applied, and the steps were as follows: (1) Random sample consensus algorithm was used to acquire the plane parameter of the ground and the ground calculated by the parameter was then removed. The target pig and the ground normal vector were acquired. (2) Since the livestock acquired was from different coordinate systems, we proposed a rotation normalization method. First, the method of principal component analysis was used to get the coordinate axis of data cloud of the pig body and the initial measuring coordinate system was obtained. Secondly, the direction of the y axis was replaced by the direction of the ground normal vector acquired. The normal direction had 2 possibilities, that was, the normal vector was either pointing straight to the pig or going back away from the pig. The direction of the normal vector was determined by whether there was intersection between the constructed cuboid region and the pig. The cuboid region was constructed from the point on the ground along the normal vector. Finally, by using the geometrical relationship among the coordinate axis, standard measuring coordinate system defined in this paper was acquired. (3) Some of the measurement points of the livestock were usually the extreme points on the livestock body contour. By cutting the cloud points of the pig along the x axis direction with a step length, the slice data of the pig were acquired and the point cloud of contour line was obtained. By using the structural relation between the measurements points and the geometric feature of the measurement points either at the contour points or on the whole pig, the measurements points were calculated. Landrace sow specimens with 100 days old were selected as the experimental samples. To validate the rotation normalization performance of the proposed method, the scene point cloud including the specimen was used to evaluate the effects objectively. The point cloud was acquired by the 3D (three-dimensional) camera Xtion sensor using KinectFusion technology. Xtion is a sensor based on technology of structured light and consists of an infrared emitter, an infrared camera and an RGB (red, green, blue) camera. KinectFusion provides a function of 3D object scanning using a sensor. The results indicated that our approach could produce a reasonable rotation normalization result, and the directions of the length, height and width of the pig were basically consistent to the directions of the x, y and z axis. In order to verify the precision of measurement point's position, the proposed method was applied to locate the neck midpoint, body length measuring point, body width measuring point, body height measuring point and hip height measuring point. Average error of the results between the automatic extraction and artificial measurement of the selected points was less than 16 mm. The method in this paper can provide a reference for the automatic body measurement of the point cloud of the pig. This work is expected to be a useful contribution for animal production and breeding genetics. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Application of assisted reproductive technology in camelidea, such as artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer, has been slow in comparison to that for other livestock species. In Egypt, there are few attempts to establish in vitro maturation (IVM) and fertilization (IVF) techniques in dromedary camel. The present study was carried out to produce Sudanese camel embryos using in vitro matured oocytes and epididymal spermatozoa. Dromedary camel ovaries were collected from abattoirs and then, the oocytes were aspirated from all the visible follicles on the ovarian surface (~2-8 mm in a diameter). Meanwhile, Fetal Dromedary Camel Serum (FDCS) was obtained from camel fetuses after slaughtering. Thereafter, only Cumulus Oocyte Complexes (COCs) were matured in vitro in the Tissue Culture Medium (TCM-199) complemented with 10% FDCS. Spermatozoa required for in vitro fertilization were collected from testes (epididymal cauda) of the slaughtered camel bulls. The results clearly showed that the maturation rate of oocytes at metaphase II was about 59.5% while the fertilization rate was around 70.4%. Intriguingly, the embryo rates determined were 13.1%, in 2-cell; 0.0%, in 4-cell; 34.7%, in 8-16% cell; 39.1%, in morula and 13.1% in a blastocyst stage.

	abstract = {Quantification of forage quality is essential for the identification of elite genotypes in forage grass breeding. Perennial ryegrass is the most important temperate species for global pastoral agriculture. However, the protein content of ryegrass generally exceeds the requirements of a grazing animal, and the ratio of water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) to protein is too low for efficient protein utilisation. This results in poor nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in the farming system by livestock, and hence limits optimal animal production. New ryegrass cultivars with optimised WSC and protein content are desirable for farming efficiencies. Several methods are available for quantification of WSC and plant protein (such as near-infrared spectroscopy [NIRS] and high performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]). However, such methods are labour-intensive, low-throughput and cost-prohibitive for commercial breeding programs, which typically need to assess thousands of samples annually. An accurate high-throughput micro-plate-based protocol has been developed and validated, with the ability to simultaneously process and quantify WSC and plant protein with a high level of automation, and an increase in sample processing of ∼10-fold compared with commonly-used methods, along with a 3-fold cost reduction. As WSC and protein are extracted simultaneously and quantified within micro-plates, consumable costs are minimised with optimal reagent use efficiency, resulting in a low per sample cost that is suitable for commercial pasture breeding companies. This is the first demonstration of a forage quality phenotyping protocol suitable for broad-scale application, and will allow breeders to select elite genotypes based not only on visual assessment but also on WSC:protein ratios for improved ruminant nutrition. © CSIRO 2016.},

	abstract = {Background: Dominance and imprinting genetic effects have been shown to contribute to genetic variance for certain traits but are usually ignored in genomic prediction of complex traits in livestock. The objectives of this study were to estimate variances of additive, dominance and imprinting genetic effects and to evaluate predictions of genetic merit based on genomic data for average daily gain (DG) and backfat thickness (BF) in Danish Duroc pigs. Methods: Corrected phenotypes of 8113 genotyped pigs from breeding and multiplier herds were used. Four Bayesian mixture models that differed in the type of genetic effects included: (A) additive genetic effects, (AD) additive and dominance genetic effects, (AI) additive and imprinting genetic effects, and (ADI) additive, dominance and imprinting genetic effects were compared using Bayes factors. The ability of the models to predict genetic merit was compared with regard to prediction reliability and bias. Results: Based on model ADI, narrow-sense heritabilities of 0.18 and 0.31 were estimated for DG and BF, respectively. Dominance and imprinting genetic effects accounted for 4.0 to 4.6 and 1.3 to 1.4 % of phenotypic variance, respectively, which were statistically significant. Across the four models, reliabilities of the predicted total genetic values (GTV, sum of all genetic effects) ranged from 16.1 (AI) to 18.4 % (AD) for DG and from 30.1 (AI) to 31.4 % (ADI) for BF. The least biased predictions of GTV were obtained with model AD, with regression coefficients of corrected phenotypes on GTV equal to 0.824 (DG) and 0.738 (BF). Reliabilities of genomic estimated breeding values (GBV, additive genetic effects) did not differ significantly among models for DG (between 16.5 and 16.7 %); however, for BF, model AD provided a significantly higher reliability (31.3 %) than model A (30.7 %). The least biased predictions of GBV were obtained with model AD with regression coefficients of 0.872 for DG and 0.764 for BF. Conclusions: Dominance and genomic imprinting effects contribute significantly to the genetic variation of BF and DG in Danish Duroc pigs. Genomic prediction models that include dominance genetic effects can improve accuracy and reduce bias of genomic predictions of genetic merit. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Infertility is a longstanding limitation in livestock production with important economic impact for the cattle industry. Female reproductive traits are polygenic and lowly heritable in nature, thus selection for fertility is challenging. Beef cattle operations leverage estrous synchronization in combination with artificial insemination (AI) to breed heifers and benefit from an early and uniform calving season. A couple of weeks following AI, heifers are exposed to bulls for an opportunity to become pregnant by natural breeding (NB), but they may also not become pregnant during this time period. Focusing on beef heifers, in their first breeding season, we hypothesized that: a- at the time of AI, the transcriptome of peripheral white blood cells (PWBC) differs between heifers that become pregnant to AI and heifers that become pregnant late in the breeding season by NB or do not become pregnant during the breeding season; and b- the ratio of transcript abundance between genes in PWBC classifies heifers according to pregnancy by AI, NB, or failure to become pregnant. Results: We generated RNA-sequencing data from 23 heifers from two locations (A: six AI-pregnant and five NB-pregnant; and B: six AI-pregnant and six non-pregnant). After filtering out lowly expressed genes, we quantified transcript abundance for 12,538 genes. The comparison of gene expression levels between AI-pregnant and NB-pregnant heifers yielded 18 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (ADAM20, ALDH5A1, ANG, BOLA-DQB, DMBT1, FCER1A, GSTM3, KIR3DL1, LOC107131247, LOC618633, LYZ, MNS1, P2RY12, PPP1R1B, SIGLEC14, TPPP, TTLL1, UGT8, eFDR≤0.02). The comparison of gene expression levels between AI-pregnant and non-pregnant heifers yielded six DEGs (ALAS2, CNKSR3, LOC522763, SAXO2, TAC3, TFF2, eFDR≤0.05). We calculated the ratio of expression levels between all gene pairs and assessed their potential to classify samples according to experimental groups. Considering all samples, relative expression from two gene pairs correctly classified 10 out of 12 AI-pregnant heifers (P = 0.0028) separately from the other 11 heifers (NB-pregnant, or non-pregnant). Conclusion: The transcriptome profile in PWBC, at the time of AI, is associated with the fertility potential of beef heifers. Transcript levels of specific genes may be further explored as potential classifiers, and thus selection tools, of heifer fertility. © 2018 The Author(s).},

N-glycans were released by PNGaseF, labeled with 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB), and analyzed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with fluorescent detection (HILIC-UPLC-FLD), enzymatic sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS). The use of a high-throughput robotic platform for sample preparation allowed the rapid generation of glycomics data from pregnant (n = 8) and nonpregnant (n = 8) camels of the Majaheem and Wadha breed. IgG N-glycans dominate the glycan profile of camel serum and present a mixture of core-fucosylated and noncore-fucosylated N-glycans which can contain N-glycolylneuraminic and N-acetylneuraminic acid. Significant pregnancy-associated but breed-independent increases in galactosylation, core-fucosylation, sialylation, and decreases in serum O-acetylation were observed. The monitoring of IgG and serum N-glycosylation presents an attractive complementary test for camel pregnancy diagnostics and presents an interesting tool for biomarker discovery in camel health and breeding. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Beef and dairy productivity depends directly on the reproductive efficiency and genetic gain of the herd, which can be related to the appropriate use of biotechnologies, such as timed artificial insemination (TAI). When considering variations in synchronizations protocols, longer or shorter periods of progesterone (P4) device treatment could provide benefits to fertility. However, our studies evidenced that protocols with six (J-synch), seven, eight and nine days of P4 device treatment had similar pregnancy per AI (P/AI). In cyclic cows, the early prostaglandin (PGF) administration, moving from the day of P4 device removal to two days earlier, which results in four handlings of cows, or the administration of one extra dose of PGF at the onset of the protocol and a single PGF on the day of P4 device removal (three handlings) are both efficient to induce early luteolysis, reducing serum P4 concentrations and, therefore, stimulating LH pulsatility, which improves growth of the dominant follicle and results greater P/AI when compared with protocols with the administration of PGF only on the day of P4 device removal. Resynchronization is another valuable tool to reduce the interval between AI. Traditional Resynch is initiated at pregnancy diagnosis (28 to 32 days after TAI) and the interval between AI is around 40 days; Resynch 22 and Resynch 14 respectively initiates 22 and 14 days after the previous AI in all cows (unknown status of pregnancy) and reduces the interval between AI to 32 and 24 days. The novelty about Resynch 14 is the need to use of Doppler ultrasonography for pregnancy diagnosis [evaluation of corpus luteum (CL) vascularization]. Similar P/AI after Resynch 22 and 14 were found in Nelore cows. In dairy cattle, reproductive management is carried out throughout the year, thus, it is important to adapt the reproductive management to few established days of the week. Therefore, traditional Resynch and Resynch 25 were set to start 32 and 25 days after previous TAI, respectively. The hastening of reproductive age of Nelore heifers aims to reduce age at first calving and increase productivity. Factors such as age, weight, body condition score (BCS), uterine score (USC), average daily weight gain (ADG), withers height/depth of rib relationship (dRIB) and subcutaneous fat thickness (SCFT) were associated with an increase in the success of gestational establishment at TAI and can be used to select the heifers that are more suitable for reproduction. These technologies can contribute to improve the national production of kilograms of meat and liters of milk per hectare, and consequently improve livestock profitability. © 2017, Colegio Brasileiro de Reproducao Animal.},

	abstract = {The incidence of peripartum disorders in dairy herds negatively influences productivity and reproductive performance. Concrete data from local areas are helpful for explaining the importance of peripartum management to dairy farmers. This study was conducted to clarify the association of culling and death rate within 30 days after calving with productivity or reproductive performance in 179 dairy herds in Fukuoka, Southern Japan. A database was compiled from the records of the Livestock Improvement Association of Japan, the Dairy Cooperative Association and the Federation of Agricultural Mutual Relief Association. In this study, we created a comprehensive database of dairy farm production data for epidemiological analysis and used a general linear mixed model to analyze the association of culling and death rate within 30 days after calving with milk production or reproductive performance. The database can be used to describe, analyze and predict the risk of production. A cross-sectional analysis with contrasts was applied to investigate the association of cows served by AI/all cows, pregnant cows/cows served by AI, days open, milk yield and somatic cell counts with culling and death rate within 30 days after calving. The days open value significantly increased with increasing rate of culling and death within 30 days after calving (P for trend <0.001). No significant differences were found for the other comparisons. Our data suggest that proper feeding and management in the dry period may lead to improved postpartum reproductive performance in this dairy cow cohort. © 2016 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.},

	abstract = {Change in feeding behaviour is one of the indicators useful to help identifying when animals become ill. The need to analyse a large number of animals at a time due to the increase in the herd dimension in intensive farming has led to the use of automated systems. Among automated systems, inertial sensor-based systems have been utilised to distinguish behavioural patterns in livestock animals. In this study, a new approach based on statistical analyses of accelerometer data, which were collected from wearable sensors fixed at the cow's collar, was defined and developed in order to define thresholds suitable for real-time classification of cow feeding and standing behavioural activity. The obtained classifier could be implemented within a software tool of a movement sensor-based system composed of low-cost devices. Accuracy of the classification was assessed by computing specific indicators: Misclassification Rate, Sensitivity, Precision, Specificity, Quality Percentage, Branching Factor, and Miss Factor. The results showed that the classifier produced the following values of the indicators: 5.56%, 93.33%, 95.45%, 95.56%, 89.36%, 0.05, and 0.07, respectively. The proposed threshold-based classifier allows for monitoring individual cows automatically and continuously and it is suitable for Real Time Computing Applications, since it does not require high computational time and resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With the increasing scale and intensive production of the livestock and poultry breeding industry, more and more attention has been paid to ammonia emission reduction from the animal farm. Ammonia discharged directly into the atmosphere would combine with SO2 or NOx to form secondary particles which can reduce atmospheric visibility. Moreover, the NH3 emission is related to the risk of environmental problems such as soil acidification and water eutrophication. Ammonia is the stench gas emission in farms as one of the major pollutants in farms. Emission control of farm ammonia is an important part of air pollution control. There is a big gap in the research and application of environmental protection unit and automatic control system between our country and abroad. Biomass removal technology has attracted more and more attention due to its advantages of high efficiency, no secondary pollution, good safety, simple equipment construction, easy operation and maintenance, and low cost. A pilot ammonia bio-oxidation device based on the biological principle and PLC control was set up in a pig farm in Beijing. It realized the automatic storage and adjustment of pH value, the ventilation control, the real-time measurement and curve display of environment parameters in the bioreactor. After the system in pig farm was running stable, long-term test and continuous test were adopted to detect the treatment effect of ammonia oxidation device. After two-month operation, the ammonia removal efficiency could reach up to 90%. The device has the advantages of stable and reliable operation, together with low operation cost. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Heparin is a structurally complex, polysaccharide anticoagulant derived from livestock, primarily porcine intestinal tissues. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparins are derived through the controlled partial depolymerization of heparin. Increased manufacturing and regulatory concerns have provided the motivation for the development of more sophisticated analytical methods for determining both their structure and pedigree. A strategy, for the comprehensive comparison of parent heparins and their LMW heparin daughters, is described that relies on the analysis of monosaccharide composition, disaccharide composition, and oligosaccharide composition. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is rapid, robust, and amenable to automated processing and interpretation of both top-down and bottom-up analyses. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides complementary top-down information on the chirality of the uronic acid residues and glucosamine substitution. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the normalized abundance of oligosaccharides, calculated in the bottom-up analysis, to show parent and daughter correlation in oligosaccharide composition. Using these approaches, six pairs of parent heparins and their daughter generic enoxaparins from two different manufacturers were comprehensively analyzed. Enoxaparin is the most widely used LMW heparin and is prepared through controlled chemical β-eliminative cleavage of porcine intestinal heparin. Lovenox®, the innovator version of enoxaparin marketed in the US, was analyzed as a reference for the daughter LMW heparins.

	abstract = {The consumption of meat by humans can be traced back into antiquity. However, the meat processing sector has been slow to adopt new technologies. Perhaps this is because of the nature of the work itself and the social connotations in various societies of being involved in the process of killing animals. The variation in shape and size of animals also poses major technical difficulties. It is only in the last hundred years that slaughter, dressing, fabrication, storage, and further processing of meat have become operations for which collective labor can be assigned to specific production tasks in a mass production environment.

	abstract = {Background: Reproductive efficiency is one of the most important factors affecting the performance dairy cattle, and fixedtime artificial insemination (TAI) is an important biotechnology factor employed in bovine livestock. The achievement of satisfactory results in TAI protocols depends of several factors, such as health and body condition, milk yield, environmental temperatures, ovulation time, semen manipulation, as well as semen quality. The goal of this study was to evaluate the conception rate of heifers and multiparous cows based on different Holstein bulls used for artificial insemination (AI). The effects of the type of management AI, animal category, and season of the year were also examined. Materials, Methods & Results: A three-year database on the reproductive management of a dairy farm was formed. All the cows and heifers were of the Holstein breed, in semi-intensive nutritional management, milked twice a day, and received a total mix ration. After 45 days in milk, when cows were observed twice daily with estrus signs, posterior artificial insemination occurred 12 h after estrus visualization was made. However, cows that were not observed in estrus were submitted to a timed artificial insemination (TAI). In this study, these fixed factors were considered: bulls utilized for the AI (totalizing 10 animals with at least 100 inseminations in each season, denoted by the letter B and a number - B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B9, B10); the season of the insemination (spring/summer being from November to April and autumn/winter from May to October), category animal (heifers, animals that never have been calved, or multiparous, animals that have already given birth more than once), and the type of AI (which included TAI using a protocol for synchronization, but cows having not necessarily shown estrus signs at the AI; ETAI: using protocol of synchronization, cows showing estrus signs at the AI; and AI with estrus visualization, without protocol of synchronization when animals were observed in estrus and were inseminated 12 h later. The fertility parameter of the bulls and reproductive performance in AI was based on conception rate. There was a statistical difference among different bulls in the same season (P ≤ 0.05). There was also a difference in reproductive performance of the same bulls between seasons, autumn/winter and spring/summer; B8 37.8% vs. 32.0% (P = 0.05) and B10 35.1% vs. 20.7% (P = 0.003). Regarding the individual animal category, only one bull (B6) demonstrated higher reproductive performance when utilized in the AI of heifers than multiparous 39.2% vs. 27.2% (P = 0.01). Similarly, regarding the effect of the type of AI, only one bull (B8) exhibited different results, obtaining better results for conception rate when utilized in fixed TAI with estrus visualization (35.5%) and in the AI with estrus visualization (39.0%) compared with that of TAI [19.9%] (P<0.05). Discussion: From these results, it was observed that some bulls exhibited better performance in situations of greater challenge. In addition, some animals presented variation in efficiency with the demonstration of estrus or not. Therefore, bulls that present semen with higher fertility in certain types of AI could be utilized on a larger scale for to increase the reproductive rates in artificial insemination. The results of this study indicate that despite the tests indicating the semen that is submitted is adequate, there are still variations in quality and the reproductive efficiency of each bull. With the effects varying based on fertility and on different environmental and management situations. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Emerging and re-emerging diseases are continuously diagnosed in poultry species. A few of these diseases are known to cross the species barrier, thus posing a public health risk and an economic burden. We identified and synthesized global evidence for poultry nonfoodborne zoonoses to better understand these diseases in people who were exposed to different poultry-related characteristics (e.g., occupational or nonoccupational, operational types, poultry species, outbreak conditions, health status of flocks). This review builds on current knowledge on poultry zoonoses/potentially zoonotic agents transmitted via the nonfoodborne route. It also identifies research gaps and potential intervention points within the poultry industry to reduce zoonotic transmission by using various knowledge synthesis tools such as systematic review (SR) and qualitative (descriptive) and quantitative synthesis methods (i.e., meta-analysis). Overall, 1663 abstracts were screened and 156 relevant articles were selected for further review. Full articles (in English) were retrieved and critically appraised using routine SR methods. In total, eight known zoonotic diseases were reviewed: avian influenza (AI) virus (n = 85 articles), Newcastle disease virus (n = 8), West Nile virus (WNV, n = 2), avian Chlamydia (n = 24), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (n = 3), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 15), Ornithonyssus sylvarium (n = 4), and Microsporum gallinae (n = 3). In addition, articles on other viral poultry pathogens (n = 5) and poultry respiratory allergens derived from mites and fungi (n = 7) were reviewed. The level of investigations (e.g., exposure history, risk factor, clinical disease in epidemiologically linked poultry, molecular studies) to establish zoonotic linkages varied across disease agents and across studies. Based on the multiple outcome measures captured in this review, AI virus seems to be the poultry zoonotic pathogen that may have considerable and significant public health consequences; however, epidemiologic reports have only documented severe human cases clustered in Asia and not in North America. In contrast, avian Chlamydia and MRSA reports clustered mainly in Europe and less so in North America and other regions. Knowledge gaps in other zoonoses or other agents were identified, including potential direct (i.e., nonmosquito-borne) transmission of WNV from flocks to poultry workers, the public health and clinical significance of poultry-derived (livestock-associated) MRSA, the zoonotic significance of other viruses, and the role of poultry allergens in the pathophysiology of respiratory diseases of poultry workers. Across all pathogens reviewed, the use of personal protective equipment was commonly cited as the most important preventive measure to reduce the zoonotic spread of these diseases and the use of biosecurity measures to reduce horizontal transmission in flock populations. The studies also emphasized the need for flock monitoring and an integrated approach to prevention (i.e., veterinary-public health coordination with regard to diagnosis, and knowledge translation and education in the general population) to reduce zoonotic transmission. © 2016 American Association of Avian Pathologists.},

	abstract = {The Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that 805 million people were under chronic undernourishment during the period 2012–14, of which around 791 million (98%) live in developing countries predominantly relying on agriculture. But declining farm returns, agricultural labour shortage, scarcity of natural resources and widening of technology divide have made farmers to quit farming or look for alternative livelihood activities. At the same time, burgeoning population warrants the best out of crop production. According to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, agriculture employed in 2011 over 1.3 billion people or 40% of the global work force. In about 50 countries, agriculture employs half the population. In the case of poor and developing countries, it is even close to 75%. However, the workforce employed in agriculture had started declining in the recent past. Since agriculture is a labour-intensive occupation, the shortage of labour, timely availability of labour and increase of wages for men and women agricultural work force worsens the agricultural scenario. Hence, to meet the labour shortage, mechanization in agricultural activities should be initiated. To accelerate farm efficiency, cutting edge technologies like robotics and artificial intelligence have tremendous potential. Among the robotics tools, drones and biosensors have many advantages such as real-time diagnosis, geo-referenced scouting and cheaper device costs. Early detection of pest and disease pathogen, crop scouting, monitoring farm boundaries, irrigation structures and livestock surveillance are possible with these devices. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Among many disposal options of animal carcasses due to animal diseases including foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and avian influenza (AI), on-farm burial has been the most frequently used one in Korea. Animal carcasses generate contaminants such as ammonium-N and chloride. This study aimed at testing biochar (BC) as a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) material in combination with fast growing tree species (Populus euramericana) to mitigate groundwater pollution from animal burial sites. For this, a PRB filled with BC was installed and 400 poplar tree (P. euramericana) seedlings were planted. Tested BC was obtained from rice husk and its efficiency to mitigate contaminant migration from a burial site of pig carcasses was tested using ammonium-N, chloride, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH as monitoring parameters. Monitoring wells downstream from the burial site were used. Leachates from a monitoring well, three wells inside the burial site close to PRB and three wells outside the burial site close to PRB were sampled and analyzed for ammonium-N, Cl-, EC, and pH for four years from PRB installation. The pH, EC, and ammonium-N of leachate fluctuated during the test period depending on precipitation. pH, EC, and ammonium-N of the leachate samples collected from outside of the burial site close to PRB decreased compared to those from inside of the burial site close to PRB. The concentrations of ammonium-N in the leachate from the monitoring well kept under the threshold value of 10 mg.L-1 for two years from PRB construction. In addition, the growth of poplar plants appeared to be increased via uptaking available N and P released from the burial sites. Achieved results suggest that BC PRBs can be used to in situ mitigate contaminant release from buried animal carcasses. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A well-planned waiting area is crucial for automatic milking systems. In an enclosed waiting area, cows of different rank compete for entering the milking station and they are exposed for a variety of social interactions. Such interactions could increase standing time and delay milking, which may result in stress, lameness, impaired welfare and reduced performance. The aim was to monitor the waiting area in a free stall dairy by the use of three video cameras to detect occurrence of social interactions by using improved image segmentation and tracking methods. The surveillance system observed 252 cows having free access to any of four milking stations during 24 h over a period of two weeks. A two-step pattern recognition approach was used. In the first step geometric features (distances) were extracted from every pair of cows in every frame. These features form the input of the second step. It consists of a classifier of the behaviour of the cows. A support vector machine was used to realise this classifier. The social interactions were identified based on collision of geometrical shapes segmented from the image and positively identified as cows by experienced observers. The results showed that the proposed system was capable of a fairly accurate detection of social interactions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Giardia duodenalis is one of the most important human enteric parasites worldwide and is endemic throughout the world with a vast range of mammalian hosts. However, there is limited information on the prevalent genetic variability of G. duodenalis in Syria. This study aimed to evaluate the predominance of G. duodenalis assemblages/sub-assemblages causing humans infection in the city of Damascus and its suburbs. 40 symptomatic giardiasis patients were recruited in this study. Fecal samples were genotyped using PCR/RFLP assay targeting the β-giardin and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) genes. HaeIII, BspL1 and RsaI restriction enzymes were used to differentiate between G. duodenalis assemblages/sub-assemblages. Our data showed that 65% of isolates were of assemblage A; 45% belonged to sub-assemblage AII and 20% to sub-assemblage AI. Assemblage B was detected in 27.5% of isolates; 12.5% fit in sub-assemblage BIV, 5% fit in sub-assemblage BIII and 10.5% fit in Discordant genotype BIII/BIV. Mixed genotypes (AII+BIII and AI+BIV) were identified in 3 isolates (7.5%). Significant correlation was found between Giardia AII sub-assemblage and weight loss symptom (P-value = 0.05) as well as between contact with domestic animals (cats, P-value = 0.027). Moreover, a significant correlation was found between sub-assemblage AI and livestock breeding (P-value = 0.000). In conclusion genotyping of human Giardia duodenalis isolates suggests anthroponotic transmission for the route of infection in Damascus and its suburbs. Further studies are needed to screen a wide geographic areas in Syria and to estimate the prevalence of G. duodenalis infection in our population. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The assessment is conducted on the basis of the progress achieved since the early eighties and the impact on the clinical/practical use of such procedures. Artificial insemination (AI) is still the leading technology used on a large scale in livestock with most favourable cost benefit ratio. All the other ARTs have niche applications compared to AI. Significant progress has been achieved in embryo culture, somatic cell nuclear transfer and on the identification of the many unknown variables affecting the success rate, while in areas such as superovulation, oocyte maturation, IVF, embryonic stem cells and cryopreservation progress has been limited or absent. It is the opinion of the author that ARTs have reached a plateau whereby only minimal improvement of efficiency can be achieved. Significant advances can only come from major breakthrough in the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. © 2017, Colegio Brasileiro de Reproducao Animal.},

	abstract = {Beef Tracker is a web-based mapping platform that provides beef cattle ranchers a tool to demonstrate that cattle production fits within sustainable ecosystems and to provide regional data to update beef sustainability lifecycle analysis. After digitizing pastures, herd data (class and number of animals) are input on a mobile device in a graphical pasture interface, stored in the cloud, and linked via the web to a personal computer for inventory tracking and analysis. Pasture use calculated on an animal basis provides quantifiable data regarding carrying capacity and beef production. This data is sought by the National Beef Cattle Association to provide more accurate inputs for beef sustainability lifecycle analyses. This application is a useful way for large, complex ranching operations to have all employees remain informed as to cattle movements and ranch wide improvement projects. Better yet, as users make changes to their operation in BeefTracker, histories are automatically recorded and stored in the cloud. After initial testing by university range scientists and ranchers, we have enhanced the BeefTracker application to improve automation for increased ease of use. The following have been added: ability to access and edit the BeefTracker livestock inventory while disconnected from WiFi and cell service, ability to represent portions of a pasture in BeefTracker as irrigated and nonirrigated, and ability to report animal unit harvest (by pasture) calculated on an annual basis. This will provide quantifiable data regarding carrying capacity and subsequent beef production to provide more accurate data inputs for the beef sustainability lifecycle analysis, enhanced map synchronization, and improved security to allow a single individual to access multiple livestock operations without needing multiple user IDs and passwords. © 2017 American Society of Animal Science.},

Consequently, it is incumbent upon researchers and managers to apply commercial products appropriately to optimize program outcomes. We tested more than 800 serum samples from mallards for antibodies to influenza A virus with the IDEXX AI MultiS-Screen Ab test to evaluate assay performance. Applying the test per manufacturer's recommendations resulted in good performance with 84% sensitivity and 100% specificity. However, performance was improved to 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity by increasing the recommended cut-off. Using this alternative threshold for identifying positive and negative samples would greatly improve sample classification, especially for field samples collected months after infection when antibody titers have waned from the initial primary immune response. Furthermore, a threshold that balances sensitivity and specificity reduces estimation bias in seroprevalence estimates. © 2015.},

	abstract = {A meat-processing wastewater pre-treatment facility was found to experience a strong sulfide odor linked to insufficient dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in the first of three aeration tanks. Historically, hydrogen peroxide had been used to eliminate the odor, but there was a concern about the cost and effectiveness of this approach. The addition of new aeration equipment was considered, but complicated by the fact that the aeration tank is covered with structural steel. Praxair proposed and demonstrated that the shortfall in the required oxygen transfer rate (OTR) could be met through injection of pure oxygen into the recirculating water line of the jet aeration system of the first aeration tank. The injector included an automatic control valve, which allows oxygen to flow whenever DO levels were below the target level. During the demonstration, it was shown that aerobic conditions could be maintained most of the day, which prevented the growth of organisms that would generate sulfide odor. The pure-oxygen solution was found to be much more effective and less expensive than the peroxide application. Copyright © 2017 Water Environment Federation.},

	abstract = {The behavioral information on individual animal has a considerable relationship with animal's welfare and diseases. Thus, perceiving animal information and behaviors are fundamental to precision livestock farming. A research review of respiration detection, locomotion score, body condition score, individual identification, behavioral analysis, etc. were summarized focusing on large animals, including cows, pigs, sheep, which are prevalent instock farming industry. And a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of different methods applied in all the aspects was presented in this review. In term of individual information acquisition and analysis(e.g., individual identification and body condition score), solutions based on 3D camera and depth image processing technolygy were emphasized, because such cameras were more robust to the environment when extracting the animal target from the image. In addition, locomotion score was one of the most important topics in precision livestock farming. Electronic sensors, audio recorder and digital cameras were used to perceive the individual information and prove feasible to detect the animals' lameness automatically. Because of the earlier lameness detection requirements of practical application, the pathology of the limbs and hooves disease, the automatic trauma detection and universal parameters of lameness without scoring system should be considered in the future. In the behavior analysis aspect, some new research approaches were emphasized including the limb segmentation algorithm and the combination with human behavior analysis theory and method. Considering the development trend and requirements of practical application in precision farming, animals' social behavior should be considered. The precision live farming should also consider the effectiveness, robustness and the stress to animals of the detection equipments, continue to move in contactless, high precision and automation direction. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

After eliminating undelivered/returned mailings, the survey had a 46% response rate. Internet access and use levels were strongly and positively associated with gender (women), farm income, farm size (acres and head of livestock) and education level. Older respondents were less likely to access the internet. For both mobile and home/office computer access, cost was an area with higher dissatisfaction along with slow download speed, particularly during heavy use periods. Generally, satisfaction levels were higher for mobile access as compared to home/office access. Weather and market information were categories of information most often accessed; while farm program and educational information were the categories least accessed. The most significant barriers to adoption of digital technology on respondents’ farms included data privacy concerns, software compatibility and system interoperability, and understanding how to use and derive value from acquired data.

	abstract = {Dairy cows are high value farm animals requiring careful management to achieve the best results. Since the advent of robotic and high throughput milking, the traditional few minutes available for individual human attention daily has disappeared and new automated technologies have been applied to improve monitoring of dairy cow production, nutrition, fertility, health and welfare. Cows milked by robots must meet legal requirements to detect healthy milk. This review focuses on emerging technical approaches in those areas of high cost to the farmer (fertility, metabolic disorders, mastitis, lameness and calving). The availability of low cost tri-axial accelerometers and wireless telemetry has allowed accurate models of behaviour to be developed and sometimes combined with rumination activity detected by acoustic sensors to detect oestrus; other measures (milk and skin temperature, electronic noses, milk yield) have been abandoned. In-line biosensors have been developed to detect markers for ovulation, pregnancy, lactose, mastitis and metabolic changes. Wireless telemetry has been applied to develop boluses for monitoring the rumen pH and temperature to detect metabolic disorders. Udder health requires a multisensing approach due to the varying inflammatory responses collectively described as mastitis. Lameness can be detected by walk over weigh cells, but also by various types of video image analysis and speed measurement. Prediction and detection of calving time is an area of active research mostly focused on behavioural change. © The Animal Consortium 2015 This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

	abstract = {Automatic milking systems (AMS), one of the earliest precision livestock farming developments, have revolutionized dairy farming around the world. While robots control the milking process, there have also been numerous changes to how the whole farm system is managed. Milking is no longer performed in defined sessions; rather, the cow can now choose when to be milked in AMS, allowing milking to be distributed throughout a 24 h period. Despite this ability, there has been little attention given to milking robot utilization across 24 h. In order to formulate relevant research questions and improve farm AMS management there is a need to determine the current knowledge gaps regarding the distribution of robot utilization. Feed, animal and management factors and their interplay on levels of milking robot utilization across 24 h for both indoor and pasture-based systems are here reviewed. The impact of the timing, type and quantity of feed offered and their interaction with the distance of feed from the parlour; herd social dynamics, climate and various other management factors on robot utilization through 24 h are provided. This novel review draws together both the opportunities and challenges that exist for farm management to use these factors to improved system efficiency and those that exist for further research. © The Animal Consortium 2016.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore the use of cow activity and rumination time by precision livestock farming tools as early alert for heat stress (HS) detection. A total of 58 Italian Friesian cows were involved in this study during summer 2015. Based on the temperature humidity index (THI), two different conditions were compared on 16 primiparous and 11 multiparous, to be representative of three lactation phases: early (15–84 DIM), around peak (85–154 DIM), and plateau (155–224 DIM). A separate dataset for the assessment of the variance partition included all the cows in the herd from June 7 to July 16. The rumination time (RT2h, min/2 h) and activity index (AI2h, bouts/2 h) were summarized every 2-h interval. The raw data were used to calculate the following variables: total daily RT (RTt), daytime RT (RTd), nighttime RT (RTn), total daily AI (AIt), daytime AI (AId), and nighttime AI (AIn). Either AIt and AId increased, whereas RTt, RTd, and RTn decreased with higher THI in all the three phases. The highest decrease was recorded for RTd and ranged from 49 % (early) to 45 % (plateau). The contribution of the cow within lactation phase was above 60 % of the total variance for AI traits and a share from 33.9 % (for RTt) to 54.8 % (RTn) for RT traits. These observations must be extended to different feeding managements and different animal genetics to assess if different thresholds could be identified to set an early alert system for the farmer. © 2016, ISB.},

	abstract = {Dairy industry is an economic and efficient livestock husbandry, and it is also an important component of modern agriculture. The healthy development of dairy industry is of great significance for improving the structure of agriculture, for improving the living standards of the people and for promoting the development level of animal husbandry and breeding industry. In recent years, with the rapid development of all sectors of society, people's living standards are improved; the demand for dairy products and quality requirements are increasing. However, the traditional way of artificial feeding has been unable to meet the needs of rapid development of large scale dairy farms, and scientization, intelligence and automation for cow feeding process have become an inevitable trend. Therefore, for the feeding status of concentrate for dairy cattle, a feeding device based on equal diameter and dual-spiral precision feeding is designed in this paper, which can achieve the accurate supply of concentrate according to the demand of individual cow feeding. The device is mainly composed of a storage bunker, a dual-spiral feeding device and a control system, and the 2 kinds of screw pitches of the dual-spiral feeding device are 40 and 70 mm, respectively. The screw auger device of 70 mm pitch is used to improve the feeding efficiency of the device. And the screw auger device of 40 mm pitch is used to improve the feeding accuracy. By combining the screw auger devices of big pitch and small pitch, the feeding of pellet feed can be quickly and accurately completed within a specified time. The specific work process is as follows: When feeding the target quantity, start both of the material supply ways at the same time; when 80% is completed, stop the screw auger device of big pitch (70 mm pitch), and the screw auger device of small pitch (40 mm pitch) continues to feed until achieving target feed delivery. In the process of design and research, the main structure parameters of the pellet feed feeding device are designed. The dual-spiral feeding device is modeled by using Solidworks software, and EDEM (enhanced discrete element method) software is used to simulate the feeding process of the screw auger devices of 40 and 70 mm at different rotating speeds (80, 100 and 120 r/min) respectively. The results showed that the variation coefficient of the screw auger device of 40 mm pitch was 0.052 2 when the rotation speed was 120 r/min, the variation coefficient of the screw auger device of 70 mm pitch was 0.105 2 when the rotation speed was 100 r/min. In order to further verify the simulation results, a cow feeding device based on equal diameter and dual-spiral precision feeding was set up. Feeding speed stability index was described by variation coefficient, relative error was used to evaluate feeding precision index, and feeding performance test of the screw auger devices of 40 and 70 mm pitch was carried out. The feeding speed was measured at 5, 8 and 10 s in different rotation speeds, and the repetition experiment was carried out 10 times. The results showed when the rotation speed of the screw auger device of 40 mm pitch was 120 r/min and that of the screw auger device of 70 mm pitch was 100 r/min, the feeding stability was the best. The experimental results are consistent with the simulation results. On the basis of the feeding stability of the verification device, the feeding accuracy was tested. The screw auger devices of 40 and 70 mm pitch cooperate in different working speeds, feeding accuracy is not less than 95%; when the rotation speed of the screw auger device of 40 and 70 mm pitch is 120 and 100 r/min, respectively, the feeding time is 14.1 s, the actual feeding quantity is 6.009 kg, and the device feeding accuracy is not less than 99.835%. The results conform to the requirements of the cow precise feeding for efficiency and precision. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {In modern conditions of the formation of a high-tech economy, innovations are becoming a prerequisite for a long-term and sustainable increase in the efficiency of industries and agricultural production. Innovative activity in the agriculture of developed countries is currently being implemented in the areas of integrated automation and computerization of agricultural production, the systematic introduction of resources and energy-saving technologies, the accelerated renovation of the fleet of agricultural machinery, which allows to reduce the production cost of agricultural products, increase labor productivity and improve its conditions and, ultimately, to increase the level of competitiveness and socio-eco- ohmic efficiency of agricultural production in general. The most actual directions of formation of innovative processes in agriculture of the Russian Federation are complex mechanization, automation, electrification and chemicalization of production; land reclamation; application of intensive, resource-saving technologies; creation of high-yielding, immune and highly effective varieties of agricultural crops; the development of breeds of livestock that have a complex of valuable biological and economically useful qualities; biotechnology; deepening of specialization and increasing concentration of production; improving the forms of organization and motivation of highly productive work; development of new forms of ownership and management; integration of agriculture with other branches of the national economy. In the Russian Federation, the need for innovative modernization of agricultural production was recognized in the framework of the national project "Development of the agro-industrial complex," federal and regional programs for the development of agricultural production; quite a high activity in the sphere of preferential crediting of the renewal of the machinery park of agricultural producers. In the existing volumes of financing and lending, the need for innovative modernization of the agro-industrial complex is clearly not enough - the innovative activity of the vast majority of agricultural producers continues to be extremely low or completely non-existent. At the same time, in the special literature, problems of a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of innovative processes in agriculture, as well as the formation of the most rational system of state incentives for activating the innovation activity of agricultural producers, have not been adequately covered. Development of scientific and methodological and practical recommendations for improving the management of technological innovation processes in agriculture at the present stage of its functioning. Within this framework, the following main tasks are to be accomplished:1) analysis of the specifics of the organization and implementation of technological innovation processes in agriculture; 2) study of the features of technological innovation processes in agriculture, including in the context of industries, enterprises and promising innovative projects; 3) development of methods for a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of innovation in the agro-industrial complex; 4) recommendations on the formation of a regional innovation system for the development of agricultural production; 5) substantiation of directions for improving state regulation of technological innovation processes in agriculture. Methodical provisions and practical recommendations aimed at improving the management of technological innovation processes of agricultural development at the present stage of its modernization. Management of innovation in agriculture is necessary for the following measures:1. On the basis of a comprehensive sociological study of the implementation of innovation processes, the expediency of direct budget subsidies as the main source of innovative modernization of agricultural production is justified. 2. An innovative option for the implementation of an investment project for the construction of a livestock complex is more cost-effective than a traditional, less capital-intensive investment option. At the same time, the maximum economic efficiency of the innovative version of the investment project is achieved provided that the sources of investment financing are diversified on the basis of public-private partnership. 3. The necessity of creating the Public Council for Innovations in Agriculture as a strategic management organ of the regional innovation system for the development of the agricultural complex, which is formed from representatives of various agricultural enterprises, employees of ministries and departments, representatives of specialized science and education, substantiates its main functions.

	abstract = {In almost all villages in Iran backyard birds, especially chickens, are kept for egg and meat production. AI H9N2 subtype is endemic in Iran. Therefore, estimation of AI prevalence among these birds is important to determine the risk of transmission of infection to commercial farms. The aim of this study was to estimate subclinical infections or previous exposure to H5, H7, and H9 subtypes and to identify potentially important determinants of prevalence of this infectious at premises level in backyard poultry, bird gardens, zoos, and wild bird markets in Iran.A survey was conducted using a cross-sectional design throughout the entire country. A total of 329 villages, seven bird gardens, three zoos and five wild bird markets were included. In each village four families that kept birds were included in the collection of biological samples and background information. The Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used as the screening test and all ELISA-positive samples were examined with the HI test to differentiate H5, H7, and H9.Among the bird gardens, eight of 15 premises (53.3%) were positive in both the ELISA test and HI for H9N2. Testing of samples collected in the villages revealed that 296 out of 329 villages (90%) had positive ELISA tests and also HI tests for H9. The HI-H9 mean titers in positive units were significantly higher than negative units (P < .001). This study revealed no significant statistical differences between risk variables in seropositive and seronegative bird gardens in the case of H9 (P > .05). The results of this study showed that among the risk variables, mountainous area was a protective factor and lack of hygienic disposal of dead birds was a risk factor for AI; this was also observed in rural poultry.The high sero-prevalence of influenza H9N2 in rural domestic poultry indicates that the disease is endemic. It is necessary to include backyard poultry in any surveillance system and control strategy due to the existence of AIV in backyard poultry and the possibility of transmission of infection to commercial poultry farms. Implementation of an AI surveillance program and biosecurity measures can be useful to control this infection and prevent AI from spreading to commercial farms. Furthermore in Iran there is no program for destruction of birds infected with the H9N2, so an effective vaccination program with regard to issues such as acceptability and cost-benefit must play an important role in reducing infections in backyard poultry. © 2016 .},

	abstract = {Introduction. With increasing herd sizes and decreasing workforce availability, precision livestock farming (PLF) is being developed in the dairy sector to facilitate herd monitoring. A desire to reduce the drudgery of repetitive tasks is another factor contributing to the adoption of PLF. This study, based on a review of the scientific literature, focuses on the impact of PLF on the profession and work organization of dairy farmers. Literature. Time savings are observed because robots and sensors take on recurrent physical tasks (milking, feeding) while simplifying the monitoring of animals (heat, health problems, etc.). Farmers appreciate the additional flexibility in organizing their work. The information provided can reduce the mental workload due to the anticipation of events (insemination, health problems). However, the mental workload can sometimes be increased due to the complexity of the information involved in managing the multiple alarms or alerts and equipment failures. The relationship between farmers and their animals is also modified. Conclusions. Precision livestock farming can have a positive impact on dairy farmers’ work and can be attractive for young people. However, if the tools are not adapted to farmers’ needs and skills, PLF can also lead to negative impacts on farmers and animals. It is therefore critical to consider the different dimensions of farmers’ work to facilitate their adoption of these new technologies. © 2017, FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

	abstract = {In commercial poultry production there are a number of diseases which are of particular importance due to the heavy economic losses that can arise if a flock becomes infected. The development of an automated and rapid disease detection system would therefore be of considerable benefit to both production and animal welfare. This study represents an intelligence device for diagnosing avian diseases by using Data-mining methods and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (D-S). 14-day-old chickens were divided into four groups. Each group was deliberately infected with a disease: Newcastle Disease (ND), Bronchitis Virus (BV), Avian Influenenza (AI), and the last group was considered as control samples. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) were used to process the chicken's sound signals in frequency and time-frequency domains, respectively. In order to achieve information, 25 statistical features from frequency domains, and 75 statistical features from time-frequency domains were extracted. During dimensionality reduction stage, the best features of the sound signals were selected, using improved distance evaluation (IDE) method. The chicken's sound signals were analyzed in two consecutive days after virus infection. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier in this study. The first classification was done with SVM and based on sound features in frequency and time-frequency domains with accuracy of 41.35 and 83.33%, respectively. The accuracy of the method based on D-S infusion of sound data reached 91.15%. The developed model based on achievement result could diagnose Newcastle Disease, Bronchitis Virus and Avian Influenza from sound signals. © 2016},

	abstract = {Change in climatic factors poses formidable challenge to the livestock sector development in Pakistan. Repeat breeding (RB), defined as adult buffalo and cow’s failure to conceive from more than 3 times regularly spaced AI or natural services in the absence of any detectable reproductive abnormalities, is a costly problem for the dairy sector. An active surveillance was conducted aimed to address the impact of climate change on incidence of RB in different cattle and buffalo breeds in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan. Through multistage cluster sampling 3 different climatic and geographic clusters were selected. Total of 1167 animals were included in the study. Out of total 586 were cows and 581 were buffaloes. The sampled population was stratified on parity basis into primiparous and multiparous cow’s and buffalo sub-groups. The overall incidence of RB was calculated 27.33%. RB incidence was significantly (P<0.05) higher in buffaloes (33.04%) than in cattle (21.67%). Whereas RB in multiparous (29.28%) were significantly (P<0.05) higher than primiparous (23.71%) cattle and buffaloes. Significant variations in incidence of RB with season were observed. The results also elicit the significant impact of monthly mean temperature, humidity, average annual rainfall, altitude and breed on the incidence of RB. The culling percentage was significantly (P<0.05) higher in repeat breeder buffaloes (77%) than in cattle (23%). In conclusion the result shows that exotic and cross bred cattle breeds were more efficient reproductively than buffaloes and non descriptive breeds of cattle in varying environmental conditions. It was also concluded that RB is a multi-factorial problem that involves a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors fixed to the animal. © 2016, Kasetsart University. All rights reserved.},

In this study, optimization of temperature sensor placement inside broiler houses is conducted. Temperature monitoring data were used for analysis. Optimal sensor placements are selected among the monitoring locations. By applying brute-force method, all of the possible combinations of monitoring locations are evaluated and optimal sensor placements are selected according to the number of deployed sensors. Optimization was conducted by two methods: error based sensor placement and entropy based sensor placement. Error based sensor placement selects sensor locations for which monitored data are close to the reference value, which is the average of all of the monitored data. Entropy based sensor placement selects the location for which monitored data have high information entropy. By applying these two methods, sensor locations that represent the entire facility and detect abnormal situation can be selected. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

	abstract = {Among the automated systems used to monitor animal behaviour in real time, those based on wearable inertial sensors are widely used for dairy cows housed in free-stall barns. However, the technical specifications of these systems and the code of the implemented algorithms are seldom included in the literature. The overall aim of this study was to fill these gaps by proposing new open-source software tools, i.e. an algorithm and a classifier, to be adopted in a low-cost automated monitoring system based on accelerometers for discriminating dairy cow behavioural activities. Firstly, a novel algorithm characterised by a linear computational time was used for real-time monitoring and analysis of walking behaviour. An innovative classifier was then proposed to detect cow feeding and standing behavioural activities. Both these software tools were based on statistically defined thresholds computed from accelerometer data acquired during the animals’ daily routine by a new data acquisition system operating with a sampling frequency of 4 Hz. It required simple installation into the building and did not need any preliminary calibration. In this study, an overall algorithm for the recognition of dairy cows’ behavioural activities (i.e., lying, standing, walking, and feeding) was also proposed. With regard to the accuracy of the algorithm for walking, the total error was 9.5% and the relative measurement error ranged between 2.4% and 4.8%. The misclassification rate of the algorithm, which discriminates feeding from standing, was 5.56%. Testing of the whole algorithm for cow behaviour recognition showed relatively lower performance in discrimination of standing from walking. The performance of the data acquisition system was evaluated by the stored data index which achieved 83%. The application of the proposed tools allowed cow behaviour recognition with a high level of accuracy, using low-cost devices and open-source software. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

	abstract = {Animal biometrics is an emerging research field that develops quantified methodologies for representing and detecting the visual appearances of animal based on generic features and primary biometric characteristics. The identification of individual cattle is an important issue for classification of different breads, their registration, traceability, health management, and verification of false insurance claim throughout the world. To solve these major problems, the muzzle (nose) point image pattern of cattle is a suitable and primary biometric characteristic for the recognition of cattle. The recognition of muzzle point images is similar to the recognition of minutiae points in the human fingerprints. In this paper, we propose a hybrid feature extraction approach for the automatic recognition and classification of cattle breeds based on captured muzzle point image pattern features using low- cost camera. The major contributions of this research is based on following aspects: (1) preparation of muzzle point image dataset, (2) extraction of salient set of features and (3) K-nearest neighbour (K-NN), Fuzzy-KNN, Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Naive Bayes classification models are applied to recognition, and classification of individual cattle using their muzzle point pattern. This paper, therefore, demonstrates the automatic recognition and classification of livestock using the set of extracted muzzle point image features. The experimental results show that proposed hybrid feature extraction and recognition approach outperforms the current state-of- the art method for the identification of individual cattle using their muzzle point image pattern. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Trains do not have the ability to steer around obstacles, they are confined to the track and depend on stopping to avoid hazards. These accidents often result in loss of life and revenue. Due to the great momentum of the locomotives stopping distance required exceeds the operator's sight distance. The Mechatronics and Micro-Manufacturing (MMM) division of CSIR have researched, designed and developed a rail Survey Inspection Device (SID) test prototype platform to serve as an early warning system for locomotives and was to travel 2km ahead of a locomotive in order to inspect the railway for possible obstacles such as human beings, livestock and collisions between the locomotives and was semi-autonomously controlled to maintain the appropriate headway in front of the train. Testing was performed by placing simulated obstacles on a test track facility in Pyramid South and data received from a simulated environment is processed on board and transmitted from SID to the train operator. System engineering principles were implemented to integrate and streamline the platform subsystems such as driving system, sensor control system and body design. The results indicate that the introduction of SID to the railway industry has the potential to significantly reduce accidents, loss of lives and revenue. © 2017 IEEE.},

A key enabler of this growth are smallholder family farms, that form the backbone of agricultural (AG) production worldwide. To meet this increasing demand, smallholder farms need to implement critical advances in task management and coordination, crop and livestock monitoring and efficient farming practices. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) will play a critical role in these advances by providing integrated and affordable cyber-physical systems (CPS) that can longitudinally measure, analyze and control AG operations. In this paper we make headway towards the design and integration of such AG-CPS. We begin by characterizing the information and communication technology demand of smallholder agriculture based on traffic analysis of farm Internet use. Our findings inform the design and integration of an end-To-end AG-CPS called FarmNET that provides (i) robust control mechanisms for multi-sensor AG data collection and fusion, (ii) wide-Area, heterogeneous wireless networks for ubiquitous farm connectivity, (iii) algorithms and models for farm data analytics that produce actionable information from the collected agricultural data, and (iv) control mechanisms for autonomous, proactive farming. © 2017 ACM.},

	abstract = {Since animals express their internal state through behaviour, changes in said behaviour may be used to detect early signs of problems, such as in animal health. Continuous observation of livestock by farm staff is impractical in a commercial setting to the degree required to detect behavioural changes relevant for early intervention. An automated monitoring system is developed; it automatically tracks pig movement with depth video cameras, and automatically measures standing, feeding, drinking, and locomotor activities from 3D trajectories. Predictions of standing, feeding, and drinking were validated, but not locomotor activities. An artificial, disruptive challenge; i.e., introduction of a novel object, is used to cause reproducible behavioural changes to enable development of a system to detect the changes automatically. Validation of the automated monitoring system with the controlled challenge study provides a reproducible framework for further development of robust early warning systems for pigs. The automated system is practical in commercial settings because it provides continuous monitoring of multiple behaviours, with metrics of behaviours that may be considered more intuitive and have diagnostic validity. The method has the potential to transform how livestock are monitored, directly impact their health and welfare, and address issues in livestock farming, such as antimicrobial use. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The permanent search for quality and competitiveness on the part of companies operating in the livestock sector. resulting from increasingly fierce competition and more complex flows. In this context, RFID is an undeniable lever for creating value along the supply chain. Such integrated systems offer dual advantages of lowered labor costs due to automation and enhanced profits due to optimization of animal productivity, health and welfare However, RFID-based systems might not be economically viable for small-hold livestock farmers unless there is considerable value advantage. Further, the set up and operation of a data recording system for small-hold farmers is also difficult due to size-constraints and distant farm units. In this paper, we present a livestock health state monitoring system using radiofrequency identification and telemetry The system can additionally be used to periodically collec a health state records and to operate veterinary service delivery. The integrated system comprises of a temperature sensor associated with a semi-passive RFID tag attached to the animal ear, in communication by radio frequency with a box that contains an RFID reader and a loca computer which treat the received information. This data is subsequently transmitted simultaneously to the server and to a small box that contains an LED circuit as a visual indicator. The central server offers dashboards on the state of health of the livestock, medical follow-up and emergency interventions. This system allows the monitoring of their health state to avoid the losses and contagions. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Tail biting is a major welfare and economic problem for indoor pig producers worldwide. Low tail posture is an early warning sign which could reduce tail biting unpredictability. Taking a precision livestock farming approach, we used Time-of-flight 3D cameras, processing data with machine vision algorithms, to automate the measurement of pig tail posture. Validation of the 3D algorithm found an accuracy of 73.9% at detecting low vs. not low tails (Sensitivity 88.4%, Specificity 66.8%). Twenty-three groups of 29 pigs per group were reared with intact (not docked) tails under typical commercial conditions over 8 batches. 15 groups had tail biting outbreaks, following which enrichment was added to pens and biters and/or victims were removed and treated. 3D data from outbreak groups showed the proportion of low tail detections increased pre-outbreak and declined post-outbreak. Pre-outbreak, the increase in low tails occurred at an increasing rate over time, and the proportion of low tails was higher one week pre-outbreak (-1) than 2 weeks pre-outbreak (-2). Within each batch, an outbreak and a non-outbreak control group were identified. Outbreak groups had more 3D low tail detections in weeks -1, +1 and +2 than their matched controls. Comparing 3D tail posture and tail injury scoring data, a greater proportion of low tails was associated with more injured pigs. Low tails might indicate more than just tail biting as tail posture varied between groups and over time and the proportion of low tails increased when pigs were moved to a new pen. Our findings demonstrate the potential for a 3D machine vision system to automate tail posture detection and provide early warning of tail biting on farm. © 2018 D'Eath et al.

	abstract = {Breeding is an important part of all livestock farming. Accurately detecting estrus, the period during which insemination should occur, is critical in order to maintain production and profit. However, conventional estrus detection depends on ocular inspection of the animals by skilled labour and this practice is expensive and relatively inefficient. Here, a wireless intravaginal probe for cattle capable of automatizing the process based on measurements of conductivity and temperature as well as movement sensing is presented and tested in-situ. These parameters can all be used independently to detect estrus. A good conformity between the data collected with this probe and established estrus patterns is demonstrated. Furthermore, the magnitude of natural daily variations and their impact on the individual parameters are discussed together with the impact of extraordinary events such as stress. Compared to existing alternatives, a multi-parameter approach like this is shown to be capable of much higher reliability, and also to be much more resistant to disturbances. The demonstrated system is very power efficient and capable of years of continuous isolated operation. Small to intermediate farm environments can be covered by the probe transmitters themselves with a single receiver unit, while bigger areas are handled with battery powered repeater units. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

This is possible by improving the backward linkages through extension advisory services. So a study was taken up with the objectives of analyzing marketing efficiency of milk types of Karnataka milk federation and to map the present backward and forward services rendered to producers and processors. Value chain analysis method was used where in range of actors involved in the business were interviewed to collect data. Marketing efficiency was arrived at using secondary data. Among 4 types of milk, ‘Shubham’ milk expressed highest marketing efficiency due to its high fat percentage. AI services (100%), obtaining feed at discounted price (88.33%) and availing veterinary services (75.84%) were the backward services availed by majority of producers. More than half of the dealers (58.34%) received advisory services on storage of products and sweet preparation. Six predictors-total milk production, milk retained for family, annual income from livestock, backward services availed, herd size and price of the milk explained 99.8 per cent variation (r2=0.998) in the amount of milk sent to cooperative societies by the producers. © 2017, Range Management Society of India.

	abstract = {Automatic feeding systems (AFS) for dairy cows gain in importance. But an increasing automation and mechanization can cause rising energy consumption in dairy farming. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyze the electrical energy consumption of an AFS in dairy cattle farming presented by the example of the Lely Vector System. The main energy consumers of this AFS and the influencing factors (duration of mixing, number of driving rounds of feeding robot, number and structure of components, feed types, amount of feed) on energy consumption should have been investigated and practical recommendations should have been derived. The investigations were conducted in two Bavarian dairy farms with 120 livestock units (LU) and 130 LU. The electrical energy consumption of every single consumer of the AFS was collected by a wireless electrical measurement system. The surveys reveal a wide range of total daily electrical energy consumption of the feeding system between the two dairy farms (DF 1: 17.95 ± 1.53 kWh per day; DF 2: 13.24 ± 2.01 kWh per day). All tested influencing factors had significant effects on the electrical energy consumption of the AFS, whereas the mixing process was determined as the most powerful effect. Especially rations with long-fibred feed types in DF 1 required longer mixing durations for a more homogeny ration quality and resulted consequently in a higher energy consumption. Overall, the investigations show that the energy consumption of the Lely Vector system is on a low level compared to commercial feeding systems (e.g. fuel driven fodder-mixing wagons). © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

	abstract = {Giardia duodenalis is a widespread protozoan parasite that infects human and other mammals. Assessing the zoonotic transmission of the infection requires molecular characterization as there is considerable genetic variation within the species. This study was conducted to identify assemblages of Giardia duodenalis in dairy calves; and to assess the potential role of cattle isolates in zoonotic transmission in central Ethiopia. A total of 449 fecal samples were collected and screened using microscopy and PCR targeting the small-subunit (ssu) rRNA, triose phosphate isomerase (tpi), β-giardin (bg) and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) genes. The overall prevalence of Giardia duodenalis in dairy calves was found to be 9.6% (43/449). The prevalence of infection based on sex, age and breed difference was statistically not significant (p > 0.05). Genotyping results revealed the presence of assemblage E and assemblage A (AI). The genotypic frequency reported was 95.3% (41/43) for assemblage E and 4.7% (2/43) for assemblage A. There was one mixed infection with assemblages AI and E. Sequence analyses showed the existence of 10 genotypes within assemblage E. One genotype that showed novel nucleotide substitution was identified at the ssu rRNA locus. The other 9 genotypes, 3 at each locus, were identified at the tpi, the bg and the gdh loci with two of the gdh genotypes were novel. Findings of the current study indicate the occurrence of the livestock-specific assemblage E and the potentially zoonotic assemblage A, with the former being more prevalent. Although the zoonotic assemblage was less prevalent, there is a possibility of zoonotic human infection as AI is reported from both animals and humans. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

We quantified the effect on fertility rate of management factors (farm, year, month, timing and order of insemination, dose of progestagen, prostaglandin, equine chorionic gonadotrophin and prostaglandin doses, age, technician, problems at AI, body condition and buck) and meteorological conditions at AI (mean, maximum and minimum temperatures, mean relative humidity, mean solar radiation, and total rainfall). Meteorological variables were converted to categorical variables to quartiles and deciles. Overall fertility was 56%. Each of the management factors had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on fertility. Non-pregnant goats differed significantly in most of the meteorological variables. Successful inseminations were associated with significantly (P < 0.001) higher mean, maximum and minimum temperatures, and solar radiation, and lower relative humidity, and rainfall, than were failed inseminations. Fertility rates of the highest and lowest deciles were significantly different for each of the meteorological variables. Inseminations performed when meteorological values were in the highest decile of mean (62%), maximum (61%) and minimum temperature (60%), and solar radiation (59%), and the lowest of relative humidity (61%) and rainfall (57%) had a significantly (P < 0.0001) higher proportion of does that became pregnant than when meteorological values were within the opposite decile (47%; 34%; 55%; 46%; 45%, and 43%, respectively). In conclusion, management and meteorological factors affected the success of AI in goats. Although technical factors can be controlled, it remains to be determined whether scheduling the dates of insemination based on forecasted temperatures can improve the success of AI. © CSIRO 2016.},

	abstract = {Automation and precision livestock farming (PLF) are playing an increasingly important role in modern animal husbandry. Potential means of automation are also increasingly being considered in health monitoring, which is essential for successful calf and cattle rearing. Therefore, the present investigation was conducted at a calf fattening unit and a dairy farm to test the suitability of an innovative measuring device for the non-contact measurement of body temperature, compared with the rectal temperature. The present results of the non-contact body temperature measurement were not satisfactory. As a result of the lack of precision and accuracy, the specificity and sensitivity is to be rated as low. If the innovative measuring device were to be used for health monitoring, it can be assumed that a large proportion of sick animals would not be detected or that healthy animals would be classified as sick. Further research and improvement of accuracy are necessary before the device can be used within the context of PLF. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming. All rights reserved.},

When it comes to the food industry, the use of robots has been traditionally limited to picking and palletization. Today, however, robots are used in material handling and secondary or tertiary packing. Recent developments with faster computers and sophisticated sensors have made it possible to use robotics in the meat processing sectors, where their application has reduced processing costs, occupational injuries, improved efficiency and hygiene associated with meat products. Compared to other industries, the working environment in the meat industry is not very conducive to robotics due to the noisy, damp and cold conditions. Slaughtering animals and cutting meat into pieces and disposing waste is an intensive physically demanding task. This chapter reviews the application of robotics in the meat industry and the advancements that have been made until now. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The spatial precision of a new automated radiolocation animal tracking system (ARATS) was studied in a small-scale (~5 ha) trial site. Twelve static tags, in a four by three grid, transmitted for 28 days. The 12 tags recorded 36,452 transmissions with a mean transmission per tag of 3037. Each transmission included the tag number, date and time and the calculated longitude and latitude. The mean location and then the Euclidean distance from the mean location for each tag were calculated in order to derive location precision per tag. The overall precision for the 12 tags was ±22 m with a SD of 49 m with the most and least precise tags having precisions of ±8 m and ±51 m, respectively. As with other geolocation technologies, it would appear that structures in the environment cause signal propagation effects including multipath and non-line-of-sight, which result in errors in the derived locations.The distance from the mean data was log transformed (log10) and summarised in order to present all data over a 24-h period. There was a statistically significant decrease in precision between 11:00 and 17:00 h. These data were correlated with meteorological parameters for the period of the trial, again summarised over 24 h, with temperature, humidity, wind speed and pressure all having significant correlations with the precision data.The variance between individual tag transmissions were compared to see whether the distance between derived locations increased as time between transmissions increased. The means for each tag showed the same variance as the mean precision values, that is the more precise tags had lower means and the less precise tags had higher means. However, no tags showed a trend towards an increase in the distance between locations as the time between transmissions increased.In order to assess whether there was any spatial variability in the derived locations, the variability in distance between tags was compared for all tag combinations. Tags that were proximal to each other had shorter distances between the mean derived locations and less variance, whereas tags farther apart had large distances and large variance in the mean derived locations.The ARATS assessed in this static evaluation showed a lower level of spatial precision than commercially available global positioning systems. However the system could still have application when used to derive proximal associations between animals in low stocking-rate, extensive grazing situations such as are present in northern Australia. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},

	abstract = {Artificial Insemination (AI) provides genetic gain, enhances animal management and enables the use of semen from rams that are in different regions of the country, high-value livestock animals that have died or males who have subfertility. Because of anatomical peculiarities of sheep, transcervical intrauterine insemination is troublesome, thus good results in IA are achieved when there is deposition of semen directly into the uterus, performed by laparoscopy. Currently, various techniques are used for laparoscopic insemination, those routinely employed are conducted using two or three access portals. This study aims to verify the feasibility of a new laparoscopic intrauterine insemination in sheep using a single access, aiming at a more effective and faster procedure with less tissue trauma, minimizing post-operative discomfort and lower bacterial contamination. The mean operative time was 5,92 minutes, there were no difficulties in the procedures and the animals recovered without complications. The use of a single access was effective, reducing the time of the surgery and complications weren't observed.},

	abstract = {The current focus in European Union research projects is more on the impact of the research that it has outside the project and after the project's conclusion. There is a strong push towards funding research that improves EU in one way or another. Thus there is paradigm shift from design and implementation to effect of exploitation and dissemination activities in new projects, even in the design phase.In this paper, we will discuss different dissemination and exploitation strategies, which cover standard objectives such as supporting the development of education, social and cultural activities including sports and the intention to reach out large target audiences. We will also discuss different modern methodologies for meaningful exploitation and dissemination of successful projects, such as User centric approach [1] and waterfall model. In user centric approach there are two processes: the design process and the research process. The user is actively involved in this approach. The user centric approach is depicted using a 7 step model, in which there are three groups directly connected to processes of the corresponding project. We will describe and discuss the various steps and how they can be followed, as well as the major groups such as end-users, problem/project domain specialists, and technology developers responsible for project successful exploitation and dissemination of the project in the paper. In case of waterfall model the seven steps are one after the other. All the input from the end user is collected in the initial stage of the project and the researchers look into the state of art, and finally propose the design where end user requirements are met. It is then followed by the implementation phase. All these phases will be discussed in the paper. The exploitation and dissemination strategies in these two models are different. The user centric model involves users at every step and preliminary results are shared with them, whereas in the waterfall model uses iterative approach for the processes. It will include exploitation strategies used in successful projects for example, Crop, Livestock and Forests Integrated System for Intelligent Automation, Processing and Control in Arable and Livestock Farms, and Forests- (CLAFIS FP7 project), Crop Livestock Intelligent Integrated Solution for for Monitoring, Control and Marketability of Agribusiness Data and Resources (CALIS-Eurostars project) © 2017 IEEE.},

In the period from 2005 to 2015 the average annual production was 58 thousand tons, which fluctuated between 55 and 62 thousand tons. This has placed Mexico as the eighth largest producer in the world and the third exporting country. The analysis of the performance of three agroindustries (AI) and the adoption level of good practices of honey production (BPPM, in Spanish) in 450 beekeepers in the state of Yucatan, before and after receiving technical advice and training through a management model of innovation. The information was collected between September 2013 (baseline survey) and March 2014 (final line survey). With a catalogue of 25 BPPM, an adoption index of good honey production practices (IABPPM, in Spanish) was established and its adoption rate (TABPPM, in Spanish). The results indicate that the AI are distinguished in their operation by aspects such as: size, raw material supply and production destination. The change in the IABPPM between the baseline and final line was positive (P<0.01), both overall and by the seven categories of the index. The increases in TABPPM were higher in those practices with low initial adoption, compared to those that already had high adoption rates from the beginning. Future research should be oriented to study and analyse which other factors help to explain the adoption of BPPM, beyond the agricultural extension model implemented. © 2017, Fundacion CIPAV.

	abstract = {Buffalo, the most important livestock species in tropical India, remains to be a poor breeder mainly due to embryonic mortality (65%) occurring mostly between 16 and 18 days of pregnancy. Early and accurate diagnosis of pregnancy can thus become a boon for successful herd management in buffalo. However, most of the currently available methods allow diagnosis only after 30 days post AI. Interferon tau (IFNT), the first pregnancy recognition signal in ruminants is one such molecule, which stimulates expression of various Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) concomitant with IFNT signaling which occurs around maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP). Hence, the study was planned to demonstrate the expression dynamics of ISGs (OAS1, MX1, MX2 and ISG15) in PBMCs during peri-implantation period in buffalo and also molecular cloning and expression of suitable ISG coded protein (s) in suitable host. Blood was collected from two groups of multiparous buffaloes: Group1: (n = 10) inseminated/pregnant (Experimental) and Group2: (n = 10) anestrous/non pregnant (Control). The expression profile of ISGs was then analyzed using real time qPCR. Expression profile of most ISGs was observed to increase through day 14 to day 20 post AI and declined thereafter. On the basis of differential gene expression at day 18 post AI, OAS1 and MX2 were identified as suitable ISG candidate biomarkers for accurate pregnancy diagnosis within 18 days post AI. Molecular cloning and expression of selected ISGs in a suitable prokaryotic expression vector was done thereafter. Bulk expression of the recombinant proteins was done and purified by affinity chromatography and confirmed by Western blot using Mouse Monoclonal His-probe antibodies. To conclude, as OAS1 and MX2, showed distinct differential expression at day 18 post AI, they may serve as ideal biomarkers for detection of early pregnancy in buffalo. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Manual observation and classification of animal behaviors is laborious, time-consuming, and of limited ability to process large amount of data. A computer vision-based system was developed that automatically recognizes sow behaviors (lying, sitting, standing, kneeling, feeding, drinking, and shifting) in farrowing crate. The system consisted of a low-cost 3D camera that simultaneously acquires digital and depth images and a software program that detects and identifies the sow's behaviors. This paper describes the computational algorithm for the analysis of depth images and presents its performance in recognizing the sow's behaviors as compared to manual recognition. The images were acquired at 6 s intervals on three days of a 21-day lactation period. Based on analysis of the 6 s interval images, the algorithm had the following accuracy of behavioral classification: 99.9% in lying, 96.4% in sitting, 99.2% in standing, 78.1% in kneeling, 97.4% in feeding, 92.7% in drinking, and 63.9% in transitioning between behaviors. The lower classification accuracy for the transitioning category presumably stemmed from insufficient frequency of the image acquisition which can be readily improved. Hence the reported system provides an effective way to automatically process and classify the sow's behavioral images. This tool is conducive to investigating behavioral responses and time budget of lactating sows and their litters to farrowing crate designs and management practices. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},

	abstract = {National livestock policies have been influenced by local needs as well as by international organizations, trade agreements, and trends of leading countries. Turkey has been interacting with the European Union-Common Agricultural Policies (EU-CAP) due to economic and geopolitical reasons and it brings with it some opportunities and risks. Although Turkey has a deficit in agriculture foreign trade for many years, there is trade balance with EU in terms of livestock and livestock products. Some of the positive indicators for Turkey are; having competitive and culture advantages in close export markets compared to EU, having young population, increasing livestock supports and partial progress in respect of farm scale and automation. However, leading structural problems such as organization, marketing, genetic improvement and animal diseases causing international trade Barriers and vicious cycle of inadequate supply of red meat can make Turkey a permanent market for countries with cost and quality advantages. Other possible problems in EU-Turkey interactions are removal of milk quota in 2015 in EU, informal milk sector (street milk) in Turkey, and the risk of duty-free goods from United State of America (US) to Turkey as a result of currently negotiated EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Turkey should give priority to "structural and social policies" to gain integrated producers, industrialists, public and consumers benefit, to get outcomes from the economic policies, and to experience better interaction with the EU in the future. In this study, it was aimed to assess the possible consequences of historical change and interaction of EU-Turkey livestock policies on the Turkey’s livestock sector. © 2018 Ataturk Universitesi.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Currently, IoT (Internet of Things) technology has been widely applied in livestock breeding. For the characteristics of perception data collected from livestock breeding IoT (such as multi-source, heterogeneous, real-time, and so on), we propose a livestock breeding IoT data fusion model. Firstly, it's easy to produce abnormal data in livestock breeding IoT due to the harsh work environment, transmission network noise and other factors. In order to guarantee the accuracy of livestock breeding IoT data, we check the consistency of original data collected by livestock breeding IoT sensors through the regression prediction method based on sliding window. We determine the sliding window size, then estimate the sensor measurement value at a certain moment through the regression forecast method and calculate the prediction interval, next determine whether the actual measurement value is abnormal compared with prediction interval, and finally replace abnormal data with predictive value. Secondly, there is the problem of uneven distribution of environmental monitoring values in breeding room. In order to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the breeding environment and provide accurate basis for automatic control equipment, we propose a homogeneous data weighted fusion algorithm which fuses homogeneous data that are collected from the same type of sensors based on support function. The support function has been proposed to describe a certain support degree or proximity between 2 numbers, and used to calculate the weights of a set of data. The weighted algorithm in this paper improves support functions so as to improve the accuracy of data fusion. We calculate the support degree of a set of pig breeding environment perception data to get corresponding optimal weights through the improved support function and then the weighted fusion for the same type of livestock breeding IoT sensor set data. Finally, in view of the characteristics different with livestock breeding multi-source perception data storage format and sensor devices encoding, the encoding rules format and data organization for livestock breeding IoT are formulated, which can uniformly describe heterogeneous data in the process of livestock and poultry breeding. Such a standard can be converted into a standard data format, which can work as the basis of data analysis and data applications. Areal production data from pig breeding IoT in Tianjin Huikang breeding pig farm show that in the data consistency test phase, the abnormal sensory data detection rate is 96.67%, which ensures the accuracy of the data, and in homogeneous data fusion phase, the improved support function in this paper has the minimum fusion variance of 0.192 5 compared with other 2 kinds of support functions in the multi-source data fusion calculation, which improves the accuracy of homogeneous data fusion and provides the accurate and reasonable basis for the automatic control of equipment. And coding standard of livestock IoT environment factors and sensor equipment makes unified expression to the sensors, which are from different manufacturers and environmental data with varied representations. Livestock breeding IoT data fusion model proposed in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy of data fusion, and meet the requirements of livestock breeding IoT data analysis. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Conventional somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technique of in vitro production of cloned embryos involves use of costly and complicated micromanipulators. Handmade cloning (HMC) technique has been applied as efficient and cost-effective alternative in many livestock species. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficiency of in vitro production and in vitro development of cloned sheep embryos by the two techniques. Cloned embryos were produced by conventional SCNT using micromanipulator apparatus and by HMC technique. Enucleation efficiency and efficiency of fusion with somatic cell (nucleus donor) were compared. Cleavage percentage was observed on day 2 of in vitro culture (IVC), and morula and blastocyst percentages were calculated on day 7 of IVC. Higher enucleation efficiency (96.98 ± 1.01 vs. 93.62 ± 1.03; p >.05) as well as fusion efficiency was obtained with HMC technique than with conventional SCNT (96.26 ± 1.34 vs. 92.63 ± 0.70, p <.05); 181 cloned sheep embryos were produced in vitro by conventional SCNT and 92 by HMC. Cleavage percentage observed on day 2 of in vitro culture was higher in HMC than SCNT (66.92 ± 3.72 vs. 55.97 ± 2.5, respectively, p <.05). Morula percentage obtained was higher in SCNT than HMC (44.12 ± 2.93 vs. 30.43 ± 6.79, respectively, p <.05), whereas blastocyst percentage obtained by HMC was higher (12.46 ± 4.96) than SCNT (5.31 ± 2.25; p >.05). It was inferred that HMC technique provides a cost-effective and efficient method of in vitro production of cloned sheep embryos with a comparatively simpler technique with a possibility of automation. Efficiency of cloned embryo production could be improved further by propagating and standardizing this technique. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

The clinical diagnosis of bovine Fasciolosis is difficult, since this disease shares similar signs and symptoms with Intestinal Parasitism. Therefore, the diagnosis of bovine Fasciolosis constitutes a complex cognitive process involving training, experience, pattern recognition and calculation of probabilities. Demystifying and rationalizing the process of diagnosis of diseases in livestock can lead to questioning empirical knowledge, in this process requires the ability to integrate, introspection and the development of intuition, these characteristics that identify the experts as Knowledgeable about the domain being investigated. In this sense, we use one of the most modern branches of computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), a discipline born with the objective of studying human activities where there are no well-defined methods to describe how it is done, in Particularly using Bayesian networks for the diagnosis of bovine Fasciolosis since with them is made probabilistic inference that implies the use of characteristics that are not directly related, that is to obtain conditional probabilities of suffering from one or the other disease. For this, a case study is carried out, which is an empirical method used to assess the scientific results of research. In the process of diagnosis of diseases is widely used to validate the benefits and applicability of the proposal.},

	abstract = {Handmade cloning (HMC) is an alternative form of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) where there is no need of micromanipulator making the procedure simple and cheap for production of cloned animals. Since last 10 years significant improvement has been occurred in the HMC process to enhance the efficiency of live births and numbers of livestock animals have been produced using this technique. The HMC has wide application such as transgenic animal production, interspecies cloning (thus saving the endangered species), regenerative therapy, besides the conservation of genetically potential livestock animals. The transgenic animal production using HMC has great potential of producing pharmaceuticals/proteins through milk of livestock animals like cow and goat in the process of biopharming, thus making the production more robust once the transgenic animal is established. Although HMC has wide application, the postnatal abnormalities and decreased life span of cloned animals still possess a challenge for us which needs to overcome through appropriate epigenetic reprogramming. Intensive research work on this aspect and possibility of automation of the technique in future will make the reproductive cloning easy to adapt with higher efficiency. In this review, we have discussed the latest findings in improvisation of the technique which will facilitate the researchers for further study. © 2017, Pharmainfo Publications.

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyse the factors affecting operational efficiency for a meat processing supply chain. The paper focuses on the operations that take place in a slaughterhouse. The results obtained by testing a simulation model and the related factors mentioned are used to analyse the operational efficiency. The study takes place in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region, particularly the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Arena Simulation software which is a discrete event simulation and automation tool developed by System Modelling has been used to develop a process simulation model of a real time slaughterhouse processes scenario along with factors such as waste disposal, and government regulation procedures that are also taken into account. The simulation model analysis shows that the current operational efficiency of the slaughterhouse processes is too low, as compared to the standard industrial operational efficiency. In the Arena based process simulation, the parameters were varied and new resource utilization was obtained. By testing the new values into the relationship it was found that the operational efficiency has improved to the initial results from 0.2193 to 0.2612. This study implies that there is room for improvement in the slaughterhouse facilities to achieve sustainability, and eco-friendliness by increasing the operational efficiency. Even though there is enough literature on operational efficiency of meat supply chain (Fattahi et al., 2013), very few researchers have focused on the slaughterhouse operations and the relevant supporting processes. Further refinement based on the factors that can affect the slaughterhouse operations needs to be studied. The data collected reflect the general aspects of the operations that are easily accessible; a study on the complete process carried out in the slaughterhouse supply chain would possibly support a better understanding of the factors and thus develop a better view of the operational efficiency of the slaughterhouse. The analysis of the operational efficiency of the slaughterhouse may improve the slaughterhouse management practices to increase the performance. The managers and strategic decision makers need to decide on the appropriate mix of factors that would contribute to the improvement of slaughterhouse’s operational performance. This study brings to light the improvement needs of the slaughterhouse facilities operate in this region in order to meet the food requirements of the consumers with utmost quality and by reducing the impact on environment which is a growing concern at present.Although few researches have studied the aspects of waste disposal, government regulation, and resource utilization of a slaughterhouse facility, this paper investigates the operational efficiency of a slaughterhouse by considering all the aforementioned aspects by creating a relationship among them which makes it a unique contribution to the meat industry. This study provides an insight on the operation aspects of the slaughterhouse and the common practices carried out in this industry thereby considering the dimensions and factors that can improve the targeted operational efficiency. © 2017 Greek Association of Agricultural Economists.

This method allows the necessary degree of raw material comminution at the stage of raw material preparation to be obtained, which leads to production intensification due to the traditional meat mass comminution equipment being unnecessary. To ensure consistent quality of the product obtained, the use of on-line automatic control of the technological process for minced meat production is envisaged. This system has been developed using artificial intelligence methods and technologies. The system is trainable during the operation process, adapts to changes in processed raw material characteristics and to external impacts that affect the system operation, and manufactures meat shavings with minimal dispersion of the typical particle size. The control system includes equipment for express analysis of the chemical composition of the minced meat and its temperature after comminution. In this case, the minced meat production process can be controlled strictly as a function of time, which excludes subjective factors for assessing the degree of finished product readiness. This will allow finished meat products with consistent, targeted high quality to be produced. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) are causative agents of tuberculosis (TB) in both humans and animals. MTC species are genetically very similar but may differ in their epidemiology, namely geographic distribution and host preferences, virulence traits and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. However, the conventional laboratory diagnosis does not routinely differentiate between the species of the MTC. In this work we describe a rapid and robust two-step five-target probe-based real-time PCR identification algorithm, based on genomic deletion analysis, to identify the MTC species most commonly associated with TB in livestock and other animals. The first step allows the confirmation of the cultures as MTC members, by targeting their IS. 6110 element, or as a mycobacterial species, if only a 16S rDNA product is detected in the duplex amplification reaction. If a MTC member is identified, the second amplification step allows the assessment of the presence or absence of the RD1, RD4 and RD9 genomic regions. The correspondent pattern allows us to infer the species of the isolate as M. tuberculosis (if all RDs are present), Mycobacterium caprae (if only RD1 and RD4 are present) and Mycobacterium bovis (if only RD1 is present). The identification algorithm developed presented an almost perfect agreement with the results of the routine bacteriological analysis, with a kappa coefficient of 0.970 (CI. P95% 0.929-1.000). The assay is able to be adaptable to automation and implementation in the routine diagnostic framework of veterinary diagnostic laboratories, with a particular focus for reference laboratories. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Teff is a warm-season C4 annual grass crop grown for forage and food grain that has recently increased in production in parts of the United States. Hay from teff is well suited for livestock, especially horses. The objective of this study was to evaluate teff and weed response to selected herbicides in field studies conducted at the Malheur Experiment Station, Ontario, OR in 2009 and 2010. Herbicides were applied POST when teff was at the four-leaf stage. Broadleaf weed control at 21 d after treatment was greater than 91% across herbicide treatments. Only the premix of 2.5 g ai ha-1 florasulam + 99 g ae ha-1 fluroxypyr + 15 g ai ha-1 pyroxsulam provided acceptable control of barnyardgrass. Due primarily to barnyardgrass competition, teff treated with a premix of 2.5 g ha-1 florasulam + 99 g ha-1 fluroxypyr + 15 g ha-1 pyroxsulam produced 7,200 kg ha-1 of teff hay compared with 4,800 kg ha-1 of teff hay for 2,4-D and dicamba and 4,200 kg ha-1 teff hay when no herbicides were used. Teff grain production was greater with 2.5 g ha -1 florasulam + 99 g ha-1 fluroxypyr + 15 g ha -1 pyroxsulam compared with any of the other treatments. The use of a premix of florasulam + fluroxypyr + pyroxsulam would improve broadleaf and grass weed control in 'Tiffany' and 'Dessie' teff varieties, improve hay and grain yield, and reduce production costs.},

	abstract = {Forage grass is an important material basis and security guarantee for the development of livestock industry. Forage grass with high quality not only provides adequate nutrition for livestock, but also has important impact on the quality of livestock products. Alpine areas are not suitable for planting corn, alfalfa, and other conventional forage grass because of the insufficient accumulated temperature and transient frost-free season. However, the forage grass requirement of herbivorous livestock is large, for example, one sheep requires 657 kg hay per year, and it is very inelastic. In this case, shortage of forage grass has become a key limiting factor of herbivorous animal husbandry development and grassland ecological construction due to the dual pressures of the natural grassland degradation and the grazing blocked by fencing in alpine region. Plant factory is a new agricultural model which can achieve the purpose of efficient crop production by high-precision environmental control in facility. Though research and practice of plant factory in China have achieved the gratifying results in recent years, applying this technology to the forage grass production is still blank. For the energy-saving production of fresh forage grass in poor environment such as the alpine region, a container-type plant factory was designed and tested. To maximize space usage of the production departments, a six-level hydroponic cultivation system(1.5 m×0.55 m×2.3 m)(length×width×height) was installed. Semi-automatic control of artificial lighting lamps, automatic water circulation, and automatic heating facilities were used to optimize temperature, humidity, light, nutrient solution, and other environmental factors on forage grass production. In a plant factory, the optimal control for obtaining higher yield and better quality of plants was essential. Optimal regulators with temperature sensing probe and humidity sensing probe were used to control the water status and growth temperature of forage grass, and the nutrient solution was supplied by bottom watering. Light emitting diode (LED) fluorescent lamp was controlled by an automatic timing switch. All installation and debugging of facilities and equipments had been completed in a farming cooperatives of Tianzhu County, Gansu Province. Four batches of forage grass production experiments were carried out in January 2015 in order to test the operation and production capacity of equipment. The ordinary merchandise maize(Jinkai 3) bought from Jin Lvyuan Farming Technology Company was used as the experimental material. Maize after harvest was dried to a moisture content that was below 13% and then threshed for later use. The thousand kernel weight of experimental maize after the screening of impurities and broken grains was 330 g while the germination rate was higher than 85%. Temperature of the forage grass factory under natural conditions was between -21 and -4℃. According to the dimension of seedling tray used in this experiment(54 cm×27 cm×6 cm), we set up 5 treatments with different seed quantity of 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 g) and each had 5 replicates. The upper and lower limit of the forage grass factory temperature were set to 30 and 26℃, respectively, and those of relative humidity were set to 85% and 65%, respectively. Supplementary illumination time was from 7:00 to 18:00. The effects of different planting densities on height, growth, root-shoot ratio and other indicators of forage grass were detected under the same conditions. And then the optimum seeding rate and productivity of the system were determined. The first batch of test material was sowed on January 5, 2015. Nine days after planting, the hydroponic forage grass with the seed quantity of 450 g showed the best production performance. The average height and yield were reached 24.96 cm and 1 891.5 g respectively, while the cost reduced to 0.4 yuan producing 1 kg fresh grass. On this calculation, this container-type plant factory could produce 16.33 ton fresh forage grass. Test results show that this factory production installation can meet the needs of pasture plant production in alpine region. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.},

However, the extraction of edible organs from the unordered organ package has remained a challenge. Traditional sensing methods and hard robotic effectors are not suitable for the slippery and deformable tissue in varying geometric constellations. In this paper, we propose a soft peristaltic method to bring the organ package into the optimal configuration for the removal of single organs. We give a system overview, discuss its viability, and point out the challenges in its implementation. A deformable xy-sorting table is proposed to order the organ package. By producing moving wave shapes on its surface, the table changes the geometric configuration of the organs as perceived and controlled by a machine vision module. When an organ is in the optimal position, it is picked up and removed by traditional robotic solutions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

In particular, the wasting disease is highly contagious in the group-based environment. The early detection of wasting disease is very important in order to minimize possible damage to the farm. In this paper, we propose a method to detect the wasting disease automatically by using both audio and video data. When a cough sound is detected with audio analysis, the Motion History Image-based video analysis will identify the coughing animal. By computing the change of MHI motion and the moving distance of each moving animal, the coughing animal can be identified. Based on the experimental results, we confirm that the Motion History Image-based method can discriminate the shaking motion of a coughing from other movement motions with careful motion pattern analysis. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).},

	abstract = {Reproduction in domestic animals is under control by man and the technologies developed to facilitate that control have a major impact on the effi ciency of food production. Reproduction is an energy-intensive process. In beef cattle, for example, over 50 % of the total feed consumption required to produce a unit of meat protein is consumed by the dam of the meat animal (Anim Prod 27:367-379, 1978). Sows are responsible for about 20 % of the total feed needed to produce animals for slaughter (Adv Pork Prod 19:223-237, 2008). Accordingly, energy input to produce food from animal sources is reduced by increasing number of offspring per unit time a breeding female is in the herd. Using beef cattle as an example again, life-cycle effi ciency for production of weaned calves is positively related to early age at puberty and short calving intervals (J Anim Sci 57:852-866, 1983). Reproductive technologies also dictate the strategies that can be used to select animals genetically for traits that improve production. Of critical importance has been artifi cial insemination (AI) (Anim Reprod Sci 62:143-172, 2000; Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci 38:411-441, 2007; Reprod Domest Anim 43:379-385, 2008; J Dairy Sci 92:5814-5833, 2009) and, as will be outlined in this chapter, emerging technologies offer additional opportunities for improvements in genetic selection. Given the central role of reproduction as a determinant of production effi ciency and in genetic selection, improvements in reproductive technologies will be crucial to meeting the challenges created by the anticipated increases in world population (from seven billion people in 2011 to an anticipated nine billion by 2050; World population prospects: the 2010 revision, highlights and advance tables.

	abstract = {Spallanzani's thought of Artificial Insemination (AI) has revolutionized the animal husbandry field, both in developing and developed countries, by improving the genetic potential of livestock and poultry; minimizing the managemental costs and holding the service of genetically superior males even after their death. AI in domesticated birds especially in turkey shows promising results unlike other domestic and wild animals. The advantages of AI are many which support the wide adaptation of this technique in the poultry industry to augment its growth. Making AI as an integral part of captive breeding programme for non-domesticated birds would facilitate the process of saving various endangered species of wild birds. However, there are various problems involved in case of birds which need to be addressed before implementing AI. Apart from these, AI also poses a risk of possible transmission of various infectious pathogens/diseases of poultry through semen or its contamination or during the process of insemination. Hence, careful and regular screening and monitoring of poultry will help to check the spread of such diseases. Novel methods are adopted to prevent the colonization of contaminant microbes in stored semen thereby minimizing the pathogen transfer. The recent advances in biotechnology and molecular biology need to be explored fully for early and rapid diagnosis of poultry diseases. This would help in formulating appropriate disease prevention and control strategies and thus safeguard poultry health and production. This review describes the salient facts about AI practices in poultry and possible transmission of infectious pathogens during insemination along with suitable prevention and control strategies to be adapted. © 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

The objective of this meta-analysis is to provide evidence for decision-making and further research on AI prevention through identifying the risk factors associated with AI infection on poultry farms. Methods: The results from 15 selected studies on risk factors for AI infections on poultry farms were analyzed quantitatively by meta-analysis. Results: Open water source (OR. = 2.89), infections on nearby farms (OR. = 4.54), other livestock (OR. = 1.90) and disinfection of farm (OR. = 0.54) have significant association with AI infection on poultry farms. The subgroup analysis results indicate that there exist different risk factors for AI infections in different types of farms. Conclusions: The main risk factors for AI infection in poultry farms are environmental conditions (open water source, infections on nearby farms), keeping other livestock on the same farm and no disinfection of the farm. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Farmers' Socio-economic characteristics, risk perceptions and risk management strategies were documented. The average land holding, educational status and dairy farm experience of insured respondents was slightly larger than that of the non-insured dairy farmers. Epidemic livestock diseases, climate risk, marketing/sales risk, feed cost variability, Poor conception and delay in treatment/AI emerged as relevant sources of risk to the dairy farmers. The most relevant risk management strategy for the dairy farmers were vaccination of animals, having own agricultural land, having financial reserve, life insurance, livestock insurance and off farm employment. The intensity and domination of risk and risk management tool adopted by dairy farmers varied due to their personal perceptions of risk, socio-economic status of that farmer, farm type and institutional arrangements.},

	abstract = {In order to measure the airflow rate and emission rate of a naturally ventilated livestock building correctly, more reliable measuring techniques need to be developed. A test facility with a cross ventilated room was built at the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (Belgium) to study a new airflow rate measuring method. This method is based on an automated traverse movement of a 3D ultrasonic anemometer across 2 vents of 0.5. m. ×. 1.0. m. To cope with the fluctuating wind velocity profile, a velocity measurement of 10. s in 16 equally distributed measuring points is needed. Moreover, 10 traverse replicates are needed to obtain a representative average flow rate. Based on the law of mass conservation, the accuracy of the method was determined by calculating the relative deviation between the simultaneously measured airflow rates through both vents. A relative error of -1. ±. 11% was found, averaged over all wind incidence angles. However, wind angles parallel to the vent resulted in larger relative errors. A 3D velocity measurement in the in- or outlet opening of the test facility is necessary to obtain a correct flow rate. This was especially true in the outlet where up to 30% of the airflow rate was delivered by velocity components other than normal to the vent. The test facility and the developed ventilation rate measuring method can serve as a reference to study and validate new and existing ventilation rate measuring methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

	abstract = {Demographic and pedigree analyses describe the structure and dynamics of livestock populations. We studied information recorded in the herdbooks of Asturiana de los Valles (AV; N = 458,806), Avileña–Negra Ibérica (ANI; N = 204,623), Bruna dels Pirineus (BP; N = 62,138), Morucha (Mo; N = 65,350), Pirenaica (Pi; N = 217,428), Retinta (Re; N = 135,300), and Rubia Gallega (RG; N = 235,511) beef breeds from their creation until 2009. All breeds have increased in the number of registered cows in recent years. In all breeds, herds do not behave as isolated entities and a high rate of exchange of breeding males between herds exists. A percentage of herds (12–52%) make some type of selection and sell bulls to other herds. There were large differences in average number of progeny per bull, ranging from 15.6 (AV) to 373.7 animals (RG, with a high incidence of AI). Generation interval estimates ranged from 4.7 (AV) to 7.6 (RG) yr in the sire pathway and from 5.95 (AV) to 7.8 (Mo) yr in the dam pathway. Density of pedigrees varied among breeds, with Pi, ANI, and Re having the more dense pedigrees, with average completeness indexes of more than 96% in the first generation and 80% when 6 generations were considered. A general increase in average inbreeding was observed in all breeds in the years analyzed. For animals born in 2009, average inbreeding coefficients ranged from 0.6 (BP) to 7.2% (Re) when all animals were considered and from 3.6 (Pi) to 17.6% (BP) when only inbred animals were considered. Due to the lack of completeness of pedigrees in most populations, inbreeding coefficients may be considered as a lower bound of the true parameters. The proportion of inbred animals tended to increase in the periods analyzed in all breeds. Differences between inbreeding and coancestry rates (except in RG) suggest the presence of population structure. Effective population size (Ne) based on the inbreeding rate estimated by regression ranged from 43 to 378 for Re and BP, whereas Ne estimates based on coancestry were greater, with a range of 100 for RG to 9,985 for BP. These facts suggest that an adequate mating policy can help to monitor inbreeding so as not to lose genetic variability. Effective number of ancestors in 2009 for 6 of the breeds ranged from 42 (RG) to 220 (AV), with BP having much a greater value, and was lower than was the effective number of founders in all breeds, suggesting the existence of bottlenecks. © 2014 American Society of Animal Science.

	abstract = {Chicken weight provides information about growth and feed conversion of the flock in order to identify deviations from the expected homogeneous growth trend of the birds. This paper proposes a novel method to automatically measure the growth rate of broiler chickens by sound analysis.Through the application of process engineering, Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) can combine audio and video information into on-line automated tools that can be used to control, monitor and model the behaviour, health and production of animals and their biological response.The aim of this study was to record and analyse broiler vocalisations under normal farm conditions, to identify the relation between animal sounds and their weight. Recordings were made at regular intervals, during the entire life of birds, in order to evaluate the variation of frequency and bandwidth of the sounds emitted by the animals.Two experimental trials were carried out in an indoor reared broiler farm; the audio recording procedures lasted for 38. days. The recordings were made, in an automated, non-invasive and non-intrusive way and without disturbing the animals in to the broiler house. Once a week, 50 birds were selected at random and their weight recorded in order to follow the growth trend in the birds.Sound recordings were manually analysed and labelled using the Adobe® Audition™ CS6 software.Analysing the sounds recorded, it was possible to find a significant correlation (. P<. 0.001) between the frequencies of the vocalisations recorded and the weight of the broilers.The results explained how the frequency of the sounds emitted by the animals was inversely proportional to the age and to the weight of the broilers; the more they grow, the lower the frequency of the sounds emitted by the animals.This preliminary study, conducted in an indoor reared broiler farm, shows how this method based on the identification of specific frequencies of the sounds, linked to the age and to the weight of the birds, might be used as an early warning method/system to evaluate the health and welfare status of the animals at farm level. This is the basis for a further development of an automated growth monitoring tool. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Several studies have been conducted using fungi in the biological control of domestic animals and humans. In this respect, a large amount of research has been undertaken to understand the particularities of each fungus used. These fungi have been demonstrated to act on all classes of helminthes. Therefore, they should not only be called nematophagous but also helmintophagous. Evidence of enzymatic action has also revealed their mechanism of action, as well as potential metabolites that could be synthesized as bioactive molecules. Cultural barriers to the use of fungi should be broken down, since the impact on the environment is minimal. In this context, much is already known about the mechanism of interaction of these organisms with their 'targets'. Recent research has pointed to the search for substances derived from nematophagous fungi that have demonstrated their ovicidal and/or larvicidal activity, thus being a global premise to be studied further. Crude extracts derived from nematophagous fungi of predator and ovicidal groups reduce the amount of larvae of gastrointestinal nematodes and prevent the hatching of their eggs, since they have been demonstrated to act with extracellular proteases and other enzymes. Furthermore, the activity of these enzymes has begun to be explored regarding their possible interaction with the exoskeleton of arthropods, which could emerge as an alternative method of tick control. Finally, it should be clear that nematophagous fungi in general are 'old friends' that are ready to the 'fight with our old enemies', the gastrointestinal helminth parasites harmful to human and animal health. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {High piglet mortality is an issue in the pig production. Evidence indicates that if the time of farrowing can be predicted, the mortality can be reduced through planned supervision or improved climate regulation. The aim of the study was to improve the prediction of onset of farrowing by monitoring pre-parturient behaviour of sows using several sensors and by developing an automated system for the prediction of time to farrowing. The resulting prediction model, named as Hidden Phase-type Markov Model (HPMM), assumes that a sow passes through the behavioural states Before Nest-Building, Nest-Building and Resting before reaching the Farrowing state. Each state was further split into phases, to allow a more realistic distribution of sojourn times. As these phases and states are unobservable, HPMM was used to calculate the probability of a sow being in given phase using the automatic sensor measures. Thus time to farrowing could be predicted at each time point. The prediction algorithm was validated on a sensor data set for about 35 sows, each followed from day 105 (day-105) since mating until the farrowing. Sensors include sow activity measured by video recording as well as by a photo-cell grid, and water consumption. The algorithm was evaluated using heuristic warning strategies e.g. that a warning should be generated when the expected time to farrowing was less than 12. h (inspired by the regulation of floor heating systems). The performance of the sensors was evaluated. Different combinations of sensor types outperformed the use of a single sensor type. Using a combination of water and activity sensors the prediction algorithm gave a coherent warning period prior to farrowing (true warning) in 97% of the cases. The duration from start of the warning period to farrowing had a mean 11.5 (SD. =. 4.6). h. False warning periods ending before farrowing lasted on average only 0.7. h per sow. The use of HPMM thus allowed a direct prediction of the time to farrowing, handling more than one sensor and a compact representation of historical sensor information. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) indicates the capability of identifying by means of radio frequency transmissions. The identification involves assigning a unique identity to an object that is distinguishable in an unambiguous way. In this original form RFIDs have the same functionality as a barcode. Regarding its evolution, the main purpose of this technology, beyond barcodes, is to obtain identified information about objects, animals, or persons by means of small apparatuses working at radio frequency. The intake of information is achieved by means of searching operations, identification, selection, spatial localization, and tracking. Identifier and identified communicate using radio frequency signals, hence no physical contact (unlike, for example, use of magnetic stripe cards) is needed. The predecessor of the RFID system is commonly recognized as being "Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)," developed in England during World War II (1940) [1-3]. The equipment on board allied aircraft had the functionality of answering if questioned, thus identifying allied planes and distinguishing them from enemy aircraft. identifying allied planes and distinguishing them from enemy aircraft. The technology has then evolved differently into systems for following the route of railway wagons, for the automation of processes in the automotive industry, for the location of livestock and wildlife, for anti-theft in the retail trade, for keys and electronic documents, and in agriculture and nature reserves, etc. [4-6]. © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

	abstract = {Live bird markets (LBMs) are essential for marketing poultry, but have been linked to many outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) and its spread. In Uganda, it has been observed that demographic characteristics of poultry traders/handlers influence activities and decision-making in LBMs. The study investigated the influence of socio-demographic characteristics of poultry handlers: age, sex, religion, educational background, level of income, location of residence and region of operation on 20 potential risk factors for introduction and spread of AI in LBMs. Study sites included 39 LBMs in the four regions of Uganda. Data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire administered to 424 poultry handlers. We observed that background of education was a predictor for slaughter and processing of poultry in open sites. Location of residence was associated with slaughter of poultry from open sites and selling of other livestock species. Region influenced stacking of cages, inadequate cleaning of cages, feeders and drinkers, and provision of dirty feed and water. Specifically, bird handlers with secondary level of education (OR = 12.9, 95% CI: 2.88-57.4, P < 0.01) were more likely to be involved in open site slaughter of poultry than their counterparts without formal education. Comparatively, urbanite bird handlers were less likely to share poultry equipment (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.22-0.63, P < 0.01) than rural resident handlers. Poultry handlers in Northern were 3.5 times more likely to practise insufficient cleaning of cages (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.52-8.09) compared to those in Central region. We demonstrated that some socio-demographic characteristics of poultry handlers were predictors to risky practices for introduction and spread of AI viruses in LBMs in Uganda. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

	abstract = {Body condition is an indirect estimation of the level of body reserves, and its variation reflects cumulative variation in energy balance. It interacts with reproductive and health performance, which are important to consider in dairy production but not easy to monitor. The commonly used body condition score (BCS) is time consuming, subjective, and not very sensitive. The aim was therefore to develop and validate a method assessing BCS with 3-dimensional (3D) surfaces of the cow's rear. A camera captured 3D shapes 2 m from the floor in a weigh station at the milking parlor exit. The BCS was scored by 3 experts on the same day as 3D imaging. Four anatomical landmarks had to be identified manually on each 3D surface to define a space centered on the cow's rear. A set of 57 3D surfaces from 56 Holstein dairy cows was selected to cover a large BCS range (from 0.5 to 4.75 on a 0 to 5 scale) to calibrate 3D surfaces on BCS. After performing a principal component analysis on this data set, multiple linear regression was fitted on the coordinates of these surfaces in the principal components' space to assess BCS. The validation was performed on 2 external data sets: one with cows used for calibration, but at a different lactation stage, and one with cows not used for calibration. Additionally, 6 cows were scanned once and their surfaces processed 8 times each for repeatability and then these cows were scanned 8 times each the same day for reproducibility. The selected model showed perfect calibration and a good but weaker validation (root mean square error = 0.31 for the data set with cows used for calibration; 0.32 for the data set with cows not used for calibration). Assessing BCS with 3D surfaces was 3 times more repeatable (standard error = 0.075 versus 0.210 for BCS) and 2.8 times more reproducible than manually scored BCS (standard error = 0.103 versus 0.280 for BCS). The prediction error was similar for both validation data sets, indicating that the method is not less efficient for cows not used for calibration. The major part of reproducibility error incorporates repeatability error. An automation of the anatomical landmarks identification is required, first to allow broadband measures of body condition and second to improve repeatability and consequently reproducibility. Assessing BCS using 3D imaging coupled with principal component analysis appears to be a very promising means of improving precision and feasibility of this trait measurement. © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.},

Meat processing workers are under pressure to maintain high rates of work, performing arduous repetitive motions while keeping awkward postures. Ergonomic risk assessments reveal that manual material handling and repetitive tasks expose meat-processing workers to high physical risk. This paper investigates the impact of automated technology on manual ham-deboning lines in the meat-processing industry. The aim is to study the effects of automation on the work system and layout, analyzing the economic and ergonomic impact of semi-automatic ham deboning lines. The study introduces a non-safety cost model for the comparative and sensitive analysis of manual and semiautomatic ham deboning systems, including the cost of non-safety. The model is tested with a case study from an Italian ham processing company. The reference manual ham-deboning line is introduced, together with a new layout proposal involving the adoption of a semi-automatic ham-deboning machine. Results reveal the positive impact of the semi-automatic ham-deboning system on the company's profitability and workers' ergonomics. As a consequence, automated technology leads to economic and ergonomic benefits for workers, employers and customers. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Over centuries, plants are the richest resource of curative drugs as cited in folklore, traditional and modern medicinal systems and are been used as nutraceuticals, functional food supplements and in pharmaceuticals. Phytochemicals have exhibited beneficial effects against human acute and chronic ailments caused due to microbial pathogens. In recent years, phytochemicals and their derivatives have been extensively used as potent antimicrobials in humans and livestock due to their chemical stability, high bioavailability, low-molecular mass, safe consumption without any side-effect as seen in many antibiotic regimes. These phytocompounds have also been highlighted to function as Quorum Sensing Inhibitors (QSI) or antiquorumones in blocking bacterial pathogenesis preventing their regulatory mechanism and expression of specific set of virulence genes or cascades. However, the role of phytochemicals as QSI has been poorly identified but many of which remain unexplored. Therefore, this review summarizes most of the current scientific contributions focused on the use of plant phytochemicals as antiquorumones, highlighting the significance of plant derived molecules as bacterial inhibitors with larger emphasis on the mechanistic action of biofilm formation and quorum signaling networks mainly N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs), autoinducer-2 (AI-2) communications and their attributes in modulating the host immune response. A critical understanding of this complex trio-interaction between humans, microbes and phytochemicals has to be well explored, to exploit the usefulness of these metabolites ultimately paving newer paths for herbal drug discovery and their potential targets leading towards a better quality of life and human welfare. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

	abstract = {Over the past half century the turkey industry has seen significant changes in the methods used to harvest meat. Some of the major changes include an increase of over three fold in line speed (new plants are designed to process up to 3,600 bph) and processing larger birds; both resulted in a six fold rise in kg processed per hour. The industry has also seen a large increase in the proportion of cut up and deboned meat (i.e. helped year round sales), as well as substantial improvements in sanitation. These advancements have been possible due to knowledge gained in areas such as genetics, muscle biology (post mortem processes), live bird handling (transportation, unloading, stunning), heat and mass transfer (scalding, chilling) and computer science (e.g. image analysis, in-line weighing and tracking). This review includes a general summary of the steps involved in primary turkey processing and focuses on several principles that have been used to achieve greater efficiencies in mechanising the process. The main focus areas include automating unloading, stunning, chilling and mechanical filleting. These topics are also used to demonstrate the importance of moving from a batch operation to a continuous line where speed, efficiency and traceability could be improved by mechanisation. Overall, integrating and automating the whole process is a challenge that must be met by both the processing plant personnel and equipment manufacturer who should understand the whole farm to fork approach. © 2015 World's Poultry Science Association.},

	abstract = {The domestic pig is not only an economically-important livestock species, but also an increasingly recognized biomedical animal model due to its physiological similarities with humans. As a result, there is a strong interest in the factors that affect the efficient production of viable embryos and offspring in the pig using either in vivo or in vitro production methods. The application of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) has the potential to increase reproductive efficiency in livestock. These technologies include, but are not limited to: artificial insemination (AI), fixed-time AI, embryo transfer, cryopreservation of sperm/oocytes/embryos, in vitro fertilization and somatic cell nuclear transfer (cloning). However, the application of ART is much less efficient in the pig than in many other mammalian species such as cattle. Until recently, the underlying causes of these inefficiencies have been difficult to study, but advances in molecular biology techniques for studying gene expression have resulted in the availability of a variety of options for gene expression profiling such as microarrays, and next generation sequencing technologies. Capitalizing on these technologies the effects of various ARTs on the porcine embryonic transcriptome has been determined and the impact on the related biological pathways and functions been evaluated. The implications of these results on the efficiency of ARTs in swine, as well potential consequences for the developing embryo and resulting offspring, are reviewed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to implement a computer vision system for automatic monitoring of animal based measures relevant for lameness detection in a commercial dairy farm. The implementation procedure comprised the following steps: (1) start and stop of the video recordings, (2) identification of the cow in the video, and (3) video processing including the filtering of good quality images and the calculation of the back posture parameters used for classifying cows as lame or not lame. After implementation, the performance of the system was evaluated. All data were gathered from a Belgian commercial dairy farm. Between 20 September 2013 and 30 March 2014, 323 recording sessions were performed, together with 33 locomotion scoring events spread over time. The first step after recording the videos was identifying the cows in the video, which was successful for 79.2% ± 6.2% of the milked cows. In the second step of the video processing where the lameness related feature variables are extracted from the images, obtained an average analysis rate of 49.9% ± 11.3%. On average 80%) of the individual cows were at least 5 times per week automatically scored. Based on 3130 complete cow observations spread over time, a group level analysis was performed in the form of a receiver operating characteristics curve. The back posture measure (BPM) and ⊖2 were the two feature variables that reached the level of a fair measure for lameness detection.},

	abstract = {Assisted reproductive technologies have played a major role in the genetic improvement of livestock as well as in the development of transgenic animal technologies. Artificial insemination (AI) was the first widely-accepted assisted reproductive technology for livestock, and this technology allows genetically superior males to produce more offspring than would be possible through conventional mating. Conventional AI has been enhanced in recent years with the use of sperm cells that have been flow cytometrically sorted into populations of X chromosome- and Y chromosome-bearing spermatozoa, facilitating production of offspring of a pre-determined genetic sex. A related genetic improvement technology, embryo transfer, involves non-surgical recovery of preimplantation embryos from one female and subsequent transfer into recipient females to enable genetically superior females to produce a greater number of offspring than would be possible through traditional mating. With the advent of ultrasound-guided procedures for recovery of oocytes from living females, coupled with advances in in vitro oocyte maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro embryo culture, the production of embryos in vitro is rapidly growing and may soon generate more embryos than are derived in vivo. Embryo micromanipulation procedures such as embryo bisection, microfertilization, and assisted embryo hatching are providing additional tools for reproductive biologists to produce live offspring. Embryo biopsy is permitting preimplantation genetic diagnosis not only for genetic sex determination but also for identification of embryonic genetic defects. Embryo culture and embryo coculture systems have also enabled proliferation of novel assisted reproductive technologies such as oocyte reconstruction and nuclear transfer. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {This study has assessed dairy production and constraints facing the rural dairy producer in Ezha districts of Gurage zone, southern Ethiopia. Formal survey was used to collect data from four kebeles in the district, which were selected from two agro-ecological zones namely, Dega and Woina Dega. A total of 120 respondents (60 from each agro-ecology) that have at least one local milking cow were randomly selected. Mixed crop-livestock production system was found to be the feature of farming system. The major feed includes natural grazing, cereal crop residue and Ensete-ventricosum. Cut and carry feeding systems were employed by the majority of the interviewed households (72%). The overall average daily milk production per cow per household, lactation length and calving interval were 1.83±0.08 liter, 10.6.87±0.2 and 24.03±0.4 months, respectively. However, the overall daily milk yield, calving interval and lactation length were not significantly differing between agro-ecologies. Among milk and milk product produced, only butter and Ayib were supplied to local markets. The sale of fresh whole milk was not a common practice, due to, inefficient milk production (78.3%) and cultural restrictions toward selling fresh whole milk (53.3%) followed by lack of market (20%). Lack of land (45%), shortage of feeds (41%), artificial insemination (AI) services (10%) were reported to be the major constraints to the milk production in the study area. In order to alleviate the aforementioned constraints increasing efficiency of AI services, improvement of veterinary services, introduction of improved forage crops and fodder trees are important. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.},

	abstract = {In livestock farming, accurate prediction of calving time is a key factor for profitability and animal welfare. The most accurate and sensitive methods to date for prediction of calving within 24 h are the measurement of pelvic ligament relaxation and assays for circulating progesterone and oestradiol-17β. Conversely, the absence of calving within the next 12-24 h can be accurately predicted by the measurement of incremental daily decrease in vaginal temperature and by the combination of pelvic ligament relaxation and teat filling estimates. Continuous monitoring systems can detect behavioural changes occurring on the actual day of calving, some of them being accentuated in the last few hours before delivery; standing/lying transitions, tail raising, feeding time, and dry matter and water intakes differ between cows with dystocia and those with eutocia. Use of these behavioural changes has the potential to improve the management of calving. Currently, four types of devices for calving detection are on the market: inclinometers and accelerometers detecting tail raising and overactivity, abdominal belts monitoring uterine contractions, vaginal probes detecting a decrease in vaginal temperature and expulsion of the allantochorion, and devices placed in the vagina or on the vulvar lips that detect calf expulsion. The performance of these devices under field conditions and their capacity to predict dystocia require further investigation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Contents: Infection with bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), also called infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis virus, is associated with a variety of respiratory, neurological and infertility health problems causing worldwide economic losses and trading restrictions to the livestock industry. Although there is a considerable amount of information about the risk of BHV-1 transmission through contaminated semen used for artificial insemination, there is no available evidence to indicate whether the resulting embryos, when used for embryo transfer (ET), can lead to the transmission of BHV-1 to recipients and offspring. For this study, cryopreserved bull semen contaminated with BHV-1 was used for artificial insemination (AI) of seronegative, superovulated heifers (N = 43). Embryos were collected post-mortem at 7 days post-insemination and were washed according to the International Embryo Transfer Society (IETS) guidelines. BHV-1 was detected in all samples of follicular fluid, oviductal epithelial cells, endometrium and corpora lutea tissues and a proportion of unwashed (52 of 120, 43%) and washed oocytes and embryos (7 of 113, 6%) collected from embryo donors. Of the 396 collected, unfertilized oocytes and embryos, only 29 (7%) were of ET quality. Most of the embryos and oocytes were degenerated (N = 224, 57%) or unfertilized (N = 143, 36%). The 13 heifers, which each received a single morula-stage washed embryo, maintained seronegative status, but only two (15%) became pregnant and delivered BHV-1-free calves. In conclusion, results suggest that embryos fertilized with BHV-1-contaminated semen may not result in disease transmission to embryo recipients or their offspring when embryos are processed according to IETS and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines. However, due to the transmission of BHV-1 via AI to embryo donors and the apparent adverse effect of BHV-1 on the quality of the embryos, it is unlikely that the procedure can be justified for a commercial application. © 2013 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2013.

	abstract = {An accurate measurement of the airflow rate in a naturally ventilated animal house is still an issue due to the large uncertainties of the available techniques. These uncertainties are mainly related to the variability of the velocity profile in a naturally ventilated opening caused by, among others, fluctuations in wind direction and speed. An experimental set-up was built to develop airflow rate measurement methods which can cope with these different profiles and can be further developed for future use in naturally ventilated openings. The methods were compared to a reference technique for mechanical ventilation (VDI2041) as no such reference exists for natural airflows. A relative measurement error from this reference of max. 10% was deemed acceptable. The methods were based on a fully automated traverse movement of respectively a 2D and a 3D ultrasonic anemometer behind the outlet of two different rectangular ducts (respectively 1. m and 3. m wide). Several airflow rates were imposed, combined with disturbances of the airflow to obtain different velocity profiles. Measurements performed with a 2D ultrasonic anemometer gave rise to relatively high measurement errors (up to -18%) related to the 3D character of the outflow jet. Two methods were developed with a 3D ultrasonic sensor in order to capture the outflow characteristics more adequately. The Basic method concentrated on the area in front of the outlet, while an Extended method paid more attention to the airflow around the edges of the outlet. Both methods succeeded in keeping the relative measurement error below the 10% limit, and even below 5% error for the 3. m wide duct. For future use in naturally ventilated openings, more research is necessary to further adapt the methods to continuously changing conditions of wind speed and direction. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Both experiments were set up in an experimental design of randomized blocks and split-plot with four replications. Six treatments were applied to the plots: control with weeding, control with no weeding, glyphosate (1,080 g ae ha-1) + chlorimuron-ethyl (10 g ai ha-1) + 0.05% v/v mineral oil, glyphosate (1,080 g ae ha-1) + imazethapyr (100 g ai ha-1), glyphosate (1,080 g ae ha-1), and oxyfluorfen (480 g ai ha-1). The subplots consisted of the absence or presence of 4 kg of boric acid (17% B) in 100 L of water. Associating the boric acid with the herbicides, glyphosate plus chlorimuron-ethyl, glyphosate plus imazethapyr, glyphosate or oxyfluorfen does not interfere in the control of signal grass. The addition of boric acid to the herbicide solution results in increases in the levels of boron in the soil and a consequent increase in the boron content of the leaves of African mahogany.},

	abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of continuous quantitative measurement of the proximal airways, using dynamic ventilation computed tomography (CT) and our research software. Methods: A porcine lung that was removed during meat processing was ventilated inside a chest phantom by a negative pressure cylinder (eight times per minute). This chest phantom with imitated respiratory movement was scanned by a 320-row area-detector CT scanner for approximately 9 seconds as dynamic ventilatory scanning. Obtained volume data were reconstructed every 0.35 seconds (total 8.4 seconds with 24 frames) as three-dimensional images and stored in our research software. The software automatically traced a designated airway point in all frames and measured the cross-sectional luminal area and wall area percent (WA%). The cross-sectional luminal area and WA% of the trachea and right main bronchus (RMB) were measured for this study. Two radiologists evaluated the traceability of all measurable airway points of the trachea and RMB using a three-point scale. Results: It was judged that the software satisfactorily traced airway points throughout the dynamic ventilation CT (mean score, 2.64 at the trachea and 2.84 at the RMB). From the maximum inspiratory frame to the maximum expiratory frame, the cross-sectional luminal area of the trachea decreased 17.7% and that of the RMB 29.0%, whereas the WA% of the trachea increased 6.6% and that of the RMB 11.1%. Conclusion: It is feasible to measure airway dimensions automatically at designated points on dynamic ventilation CT using research software. This technique can be applied to various airway and obstructive diseases. © 2015, Yamashiro et al.},

The antibiotics to be added and their concentrations for semen for international trade are specified by government directives. Since the animal production industry uses large quantities of semen for artificial insemination, large amounts of antibiotics are currently used in semen extenders. Possible alternatives to antibiotics are discussed, including physical removal of the bacteria during semen processing, as well as the development of novel antimicrobials. Colloid centrifugation, particularly Single Layer Centrifugation, when carried out with a strict aseptic technique, offers a feasible method for reducing bacterial contamination in semen and is a practical method for semen processing laboratories to adopt.

Meat consumption is generally above dietary recommendations in many countries, including Italy, and it is increasing in developing countries. Although meat is a source of essential nutrients, it provides large amounts of saturated fat, which is a known risk factor for obesity and for several diseases such as stroke, breast cancer and colon cancer. Dietary changes, with lower intake of red and processed meat, are likely to be beneficial for improving health and for the environment by reducing emissions of GHG. Data on meat consumption in Italy among adults, referred to the last ten years, shows heterogeneity among regions, with the highest consumption in the North-western regions and generally with higher consumption among males. We describe meat consumption distribution worldwide, in Europe and Italy. An assessment of the potential environmental and health co-benefits considering different reduction scenarios of red meat consumption in Italy is provided. Dietary changes can substantially lower GHG and coordinated actions are needed across public health and other sectors to promote healthy, low-emission diets.},

Moon exerted a significant effect on fertility rate (p < 0.001), with a significant interaction with type of oestrus (p < 0.05). The effect on fecundity was significant (p < 0.05), so that the number of lambs obtained per inseminated ewe was higher during the new and the decrescent moons (New moon: 0.80 ± 0.05; Crescent moon: 0.62 ± 0.04; Full moon: 0.65 ± 0.03; Decrescent moon: 0.80 ± 0.02 lambs/inseminated ewe). An interaction (p < 0.05) between lunar phase and type of oestrus was detected, so that the effect of moon on this parameter was different depending on how oestrus was obtained. In conclusion, moon can affect lamb production after AI in sheep through changes in fertility rates throughout its different phases.

In addition to these services, uprising and downsizing of stock prices can affect the management behavior in regard to the production services. In order to solve the issue, both the health and diet management plans are monitored and modified automatically with respect to the changes in the stock market.

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification has greatly decreased grassland surface area in some regions, thus changing grassland management and modifying environmental and socio-economic systems. Therefore, knowledge about grassland management practices in farming systems is needed for sustainable agriculture. In this context, the PaturMata model simulates grassland management at the farm scale. The PaturMata model simulates grassland dynamics and several factors such as farming practices, grass consumption, and fertilization. The model takes into account environmental and farming system parameters such as climate, field number, size, and location; livestock units; and conventional or organic agriculture. Here, we first ran the model under climatic conditions favorable to grass growth for four farms on an experimental site located in western France. Biophysical variables extracted from remote-sensing images were used to initialize PaturMata, whose predictions were compared to on-site surveys. We generated forecasting scenarios of the same farms under different climatic conditions. Results show that PaturMata predicts a 70 % decrease in grass consumption, a 50 % decrease in the number of annual grazing periods, and a 60 % increase in the amount of conserved forage consumed, when conditions are unfavorable to grass growth. We conclude that the PaturMata model can help design farms and management strategies capable of coping with a wide range of conditions. © 2015, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.},

	abstract = {Animal manure and human wastewater contains Chemicals of Emerging Concerns (CECs) that potentially cause undesirable ecological or health effects. For instance, estrogenic hormones such as 17β - estradiol (E2) can have adverse effects on the reproductive biology of vertebrates at low concentration range (10-100 ng/L) (Irwin et at., 2001; Routledge et al., 1998; Schuh et ai, 2011). Antibiotics resistant bacteria that cause life threatening infections can be developed from exposure to low level of antibiotics because 30 - 90% of drugs are excreted unaltered state in urine and feces (Wise et al., 1998; Sarmah et al., 2006; Berge et al., 2006). Another important aspect of the manure management is to reduce the sustainability concerns and increase the application of waste to energy process by enhancing renewable energy production. The Liquid Portion of Animal Manure (LPAM) was produced using 0.45 pm filter from swine manure slurry that contains many bioactive compounds because livestock manure is typically more concentrated with less treatment than human waste. A mixed algal bacterial bioreactor was operated to extract CECs from the LP AM with increasing organic loading rates (190.5 to 571.4 mg sCOD/Ud), and biomass was harvested for biofuel feedstock. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and catalytic hydrothermal gasification (CHG) were performed with 8 different conditions (Tempt: 200 - 350 °C; Time: 30 - 60 min) to determine the optimal conditions for renewable energy production and their effects on the fate of bioactive CECs. Assay Design ELISA tests and GC/MS analysis were used to measure concentrations of the CECs (17β - estradiol) pre-and post-algal bioreactor and hydrothermal conversion processes. The goal of research is to investigate a novel treatment system, using the combination of the thermochemical waste to energy processes with the algal treatment, can synergistically extract CECs from manure and convert them into valuable bioenergy. The concentration of sCOD and E2 in the LPAM were 3937 mg/L and 132 - 165 ng/L. The biomass productivity of mixed algal bioreactor was 819mg/Ud under 517 mg sCOD/Ud loading rate, and influent sCOD and TN (3937 mg/L; 1540 mg/L) were decreased to 720 mg/L and 430 mg/L. The optimal operating conditions of HTL for bioenergy and CECs removal was 300 °C and 60 min. This research will contribute to develop a cost-effective system to reduce water pollution and increase bioenergy production opportunities for reuse of the aqueous fraction of manure. The main approach of this research is to develop and analyze a novel and cost-effective manure management system that can simultaneously produce bioenergy and remove emerging contaminants. These following list identifies the specific objectives designed to achieve this goal: 1) Develop and apply analytical methods to characterize the liquid portion of animal manure (LPAM) and the impacts of bioactive chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in the LPAM. Develop a fluctuation test to measure antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations exposed to antibiotics in wastewater and eliminates false negatives. 2) Demonstrate the ability to extract and concentrate CECs and other organics from LPAM to create a feedstock for bioenergy production. 3) Survey a range of reaction temperatures and reaction times for the determination of suitable conditions for providing both removal of bioactive CECs and bio-energy production via hydrothermal conversion processes. Develop a method to analyze antibiotics and their breakdown products in LPAM and the HTL aqueous phase. 4) Integrate the process.},

The correlation coefficients were found to be highest between BW and BL (0.86) and lowest between RW and PG (-0.32). Principal component (PC) analysis after varimax rotation produced four PCs which showed 85.84 per cent of the total variation. The coefficient of determination (R2) value was found to be 0.74 when BL was included in the prediction model, but it increased to 0.87 when the other linear measurements viz.

However, meat processing companies struggle with the collection and provision of detailed data, as production processes are complex and variable. Recent research showed that automated sensor systems could provide environment relevant information. Nonetheless, these sensors are not diffused in practice. One solution is the usage of mobile devices in production processes to collect environmental data for product carbon footprints.

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI) is an assisted reproductive technique that is implemented successfully in humans as a fertility treatment, performed extensively for commercial breeding of livestock, and is also successful in laboratory rodents. AI in the mouse may be especially useful for breeding of transgenic or mutant mice with fertility problems, expansion of mouse colonies, and as an alternative to in vitro fertilization. Nonsurgical AI techniques for the mouse have been described previously but are not often implemented due to technical difficulties. Here we compare various protocols for preparation of CD1 recipients prior to AI for naïve (in estrus), ovulation-induced, and superovulated females. Timing of hormone administration relative to sperm delivery is also compared. An improved protocol for nonsurgical AI in mice is described, which incorporates a convenient hormone administration schedule for female recipients and rapid, non-stressful sperm transfer without the need for anesthesia or analgesia. © 2015, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Estimations of world population growth indicate that by the year 2050 we will reach nine billion habitants on earth. These estimates impose a tremendous challenge in the current agricultural systems as food supply will need to increase by 100 % in the next 40 years (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2009 ). Beef will be a primary protein source that will assist in meeting the requirements for a portion of the protein in diets of this expanding global populace. Beef is a high-quality protein that contains all essential amino acids for the human body and also contains additional essential nutrients such as iron, zinc, B vitamins, ribofl avin, selenium, choline, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Adopting reproductive technologies at greater rates than currently used is a viable method to dramatically enhance production effi ciency of beef cattle enterprises. Artifi cial insemination (AI), estrous synchronization and fi xed-Time AI (TAI), semen and embryo cryopreservation, multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro fertilization, sex determination of sperm or embryos, and nuclear transfer are technologies that are used to enhance the production effi ciency of beef operations. In many cases, the development of these technologies is responsible for signifi cant changes to traditional livestock production practices. However, adoption of these technologies appears to has not grown at the same rate in the United States as other formidable beef producing nations. For example, sales of beef semen for AI increased from 3.3 to 11.9 million units between 1993 and 2011 in Brazil, whereas that in the United States has increased from 2.9 to 3.8 million units during the same period. The signifi cant increases in adoption of reproductive technologies in developing countries is likely as a result of the development of practical estrous synchronization and TAI systems that have allowed beef producers the opportunity to eliminate detection of estrus in their AI programs with a high degree of success. In the United States, slow adoption rates of these technologies may result in a future loss of international market share of beef products as other nations take advantage not only of the additional kilogram of beef that can be produced but also the improved quality of beef that can be realized through incorporation of reproductive technologies and resultant genetic improvement. However, current diffi culties the US producers have with the incorporation of applied reproductive technologies, such as TAI, MOET, and sex semen, must not be the reason to overlook and incorporate more traditional reproductive technologies such as castration, breeding season management, or weaning. In many cases, beef producers in the United States fail to incorporate these more traditional technologies, which results in a reduction in production effi ciency of the US beef industry. This chapter will focus on both traditional and more developed reproductive technologies that will play a role in enhancing future production effi ciencies of the US beef cattle production system.},

	abstract = {At present, animal offal is either processed manually or left unprocessed if sufficient labor is not available. In lamb meat processing, robotic solutions have been developed for removing the pelt, the internal organs, and the bones. Traditional robotic sensing and manipulation is, however, not applicable to handling the soft, slippery, and unordered organ package. We hypothesize that the problem of automatically sorting animal offal can be solved by a soft actuation technique and industrial robotics in conjunction with machine vision. In this article, we structure the technical approach, discuss its viability based on the available literature, and point out where its challenges lie. To this end, we conceptualize a robotic sorting system in which a peristaltic table is used to order the organ package. The ordering process is controlled using visual feedback from the automatic recognition of the organs. When an organ is in optimal position, it is picked up and lifted by a soft vacuum gripper. The exposed tissue connections to the organ package are cut and the organ is removed from the table. Gripper and cutter are mounted on a bi-arm robot. The peristaltic table has a soft silicone surface with a matrix of independently inflatable cells. By controlling inflation, moving wave shapes are produced that drive the organ package on the surface. Organs are recognized from sets of neighboring local features in color-depth images. Constellations of organs will be recognized by partitioning the feature space of a spatially sensitive multiorgan descriptor. A graphical model relates peristaltic movement patterns to organ configurations. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Analysis of genomic data is increasingly becoming part of the livestock industry. Therefore, the routine collection of genomic information would be an invaluable resource for effective management of breeding programs in small, endangered populations. The objective of the paper was to demonstrate how genomic data could be used to analyse (1) linkage disequlibrium (LD), LD decay and the effective population size (NeLD); (2) Inbreeding level and effective population size (NeROH) based on runs of homozygosity (ROH); (3) Prediction of genomic breeding values (GEBV) using small within-breed and genomic information from other breeds. The Tyrol Grey population was used as an example, with the goal to highlight the potential of genomic analyses for small breeds. In addition to our own results we discuss additional use of genomics to assess relatedness, admixture proportions, and inheritance of harmful variants. The example data set consisted of 218 Tyrol Grey bull genotypes, which were all available AI bulls in the population. After standard quality control restrictions 34,581 SNPs remained for the analysis. A separate quality control was applied to determine ROH levels based on Illumina GenCall and Illumina GenTrain scores, resulting into 211 bulls and 33,604 SNPs. LD was computed as the squared correlation coefficient between SNPs within a 10 mega base pair (Mb) region. ROHs were derived based on regions covering at least 4, 8, and 16 Mb, suggesting that animals had common ancestors approximately 12, 6, and 3 generations ago, respectively. The corresponding mean inbreeding coefficients (FROH) were 4.0% for 4 Mb, 2.9% for 8 Mb and 1.6% for 16 Mb runs. With an average generation interval of 5.66 years, estimated NeROH was 125 (NeROH>16 Mb), 186 (NeROH>8 Mb) and 370 (NeROH>4 Mb) indicating strict avoidance of close inbreeding in the population. The LD was used as an alternative method to infer the population history and the Ne. The results show a continuous decrease in NeLD, to 780, 120, and 80 for 100, 10, and 5 generations ago, respectively. Genomic selection was developed for and is working well in large breeds. The same methodology was applied in Tyrol Grey cattle, using different reference populations. Contrary to the expectations, the accuracy of GEBVs with very small within breed reference populations were very high, between 0.13-0.91 and 0.12-0.63, when estimated breeding values and deregressed breeding values were used as pseudo-phenotypes, respectively. Subsequent analyses confirmed the high accuracies being a consequence of low reliabilities of pseudo-phenotypes in the validation set, thus being heavily influenced by parent averages. Multi-breed and across breed reference sets gave inconsistent and lower accuracies. Genomic information may have a crucial role in management of small breeds, even if its primary usage differs from that of large breeds. It allows to assess relatedness between individuals, trends in inbreeding and to take decisions accordingly. These decisions would be based on the real genome architecture, rather than conventional pedigree information, which can be missing or incomplete. We strongly suggest the routine genotyping of all individuals that belong to a small breed in order to facilitate the effective management of endangered livestock populations. © 2015 Mészáros, Boison, Pérez O'Brien, Ferenčaković, Curik, Da Silva, Utsunomiya, Garcia and Sölkner.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The mechanization of the meat cutting companies has become essential due to the lack of skilled workers and to working conditions. This paper deals with the analysis of human gestures in order to improve the performance of a redundant robotic cell. The aim is to define optimization criteria linked to the process and the human gesture analysis to improve the cutting process with a redundant robotic cell. Design/methodology/approach - This paper deals with an optimized path planning of complex tasks based on the human arm analysis. The first part details the operator's manual work. The robotized cutting strategy using bones as a guide associated with an industrial force control leads to the tasks redefinition. Thus, the analysis of the arm during the tasks is presented. With a robotic model, the authors evaluate the relevance of two criteria (kinematic and mechanical) that the operator naturally manages. These criteria are used to improve the robotized cutting process by using redundancy. Simulation work and experimentation are presented to show the enhanced performance. Findings - The paper explains how to define optimization criteria based on human arm analysis to realize cutting operations which require force or dexterity performance. It presents a study on the criteria weighting on a robotic arm model established through human arm analysis. The optimized cutting process clearly shows improvement. Research limitations/implications - The scalability of the ham implied the definition of iterative trajectories to follow the curvature of the bone. Due to the use of an industrial force control, no online optimization can be achieved. The off-line optimization implies that the boundary of the trajectory space is technically feasible. Nevertheless, more information has to be extracted from the deboning process such as vision data in order to improve cutting quality. Practical implications - This study was carried out within the framework of several national and European projects (FUI SRDViand, ANR ARMS, FP7 Echord Dexdeb) in collaboration with ADIV (Meat Institute Development Agency). The redundant robotic cell was developed and implemented at ADIV and used for feasibility studies in connection with SME/SMI French sector. Originality/value - The paper deals with the cutting of soft bodies such as meat and complex human gesture analysis, which constitute an innovative challenge for the coming years in order to help or replace humans in industrial meat companies with difficult working conditions.

	abstract = {As the foundation of large-scale breeding of livestock and poultry, mechanization is the springhead to improve the efficiency of livestock and poultry breeding. Although it may have been greatly improved, the mechanization of China's livestock and poultry breeding is still facing problems such as low degree of automation and underinvestment. Therefore, studies on the influence of mechanization on the technical efficiency of livestock and poultry breeding are extremely important for improving China's livestock and poultry breeding and realizing the modernized large-scale livestock and poultry breeding. This paper obtained the production and business operation data of 402 farmers breeding layers on a large scale in China's 5 major egg-producing provinces through field survey. Besides, it used DEA (data envelopment analysis) method to calculate the technical efficiency of large-scale layer breeding. Based on that, it used Tobit model to analyze the influence of mechanization on the technical efficiency of large-scale layer breeding. The result shows that, according to the evaluation standard on layer breeding machinery specified in the acceptance standard of standardized demonstration layer farms, large-scale breeding of layers in current China is still insufficiently mechanized; with the improvement of mechanization, farmers breeding layers on a large scale are gradually decreasing, which indicates that the mechanization of layer breeding has a potentially large room for improvement; mechanization of layer breeding is better than traditional breeding in both overall and pure technical efficiency. With the improvement of mechanization, both the comprehensive technical efficiency and pure technical efficiency of layer breeding are increasing, indicating that mechanized breeding enjoys a technological superiority; verified by Tobit model, farmers breeding layers on a large scale are poorly mechanized; whereas the mechanization effectively improves the technical efficiency of large-scale layer breading, i. e., mechanized breeding plays a positive role in improving the technical efficiency of layer breeding. It shows that the mechanization of livestock and poultry breeding, which is promoted in China, has clearly demonstrated its advantages on the improvement of livestock and poultry breeding. Besides, the field survey shows that the mechanization greatly facilitates the development of standardized and large-scale layer breeding. Therefore, under the background that labor cost keeps growing and employing labors for layer breeding gets increasingly difficult, mechanization should be promoted to improve the layer breeding. In addition, the number of farmers who have a good education background and breeding training is in significantly direct proportion to the scale, region and technical efficiency of large-scale layer breeding, while the number of labors in layer breeding is in significantly reciprocal proportion to the technical efficiency of layer breeding. Based on the practical situation of different regions, therefore, governments at all levels should, through training, site instruction and publicity, etc., continuously improve the quality and breeding skills of chicken farm owners and decision-makers, and keep promoting the standardized and large-scale layer breeding. © 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Human wastewater and livestock can contribute to contamination of surface water with Cryptosporidium and Giardia. In countries where a substantial proportion of drinking water is produced from surface water, e.g., Belgium, this poses a constant threat on drinking water safety. Our objective was to monitor the presence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in different water catchment sites in Belgium and to discriminate between (oo)cysts from human or animal origin using genotyping. Monthly samples were collected from raw water and purified drinking water at four catchment sites. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were detected using USEPA method 1623 and positive samples were genotyped. No contamination was found in purified water at any site. In three catchments, only low numbers of (oo)cysts were recovered from raw water samples (<1/liter), but raw water samples from one catchment site were frequently contaminated with Giardia (92 %) and Cryptosporidium (96 %), especially in winter and spring. Genotyping of Giardia in 38 water samples identified the presence of Giardia duodenalis assemblage AI, AII, BIV, BIV-like, and E. Cryptosporidium andersoni, Cryptosporidium suis, Cryptosporidium horse genotype, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Cryptosporidium hominis were detected. The genotyping results suggest that agriculture may be a more important source of surface water contamination than human waste in this catchment. In catchment sites with contaminated surface water, such as the Blankaart, continuous monitoring of treated water for the presence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia would be justified and (point) sources of surface water contamination should be identified. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Artificial insemination (AI) is the oldest and most widely used assisted reproductive technique applied in livestock production. Associated with preservation of sperm, artificial insemination, offers many advantages to farmers, since it allows accelerating the genetic improvement of the herd, control sexually transmitted diseases, as well as preserve of the genetic material of endangered breeds. However, in goats this technique is little used compared to other species. This is due to, in part, to the fertility results irregular and generally low obtained with the use of frozen semen. Recent advances in this technology have been focused primarily on preserving the viability/fertilizing capacity of sperm by improving the composition of extenders and by changing cooling/freezing protocols and in the sperm assessment techniques predictive to field fertility. The other main issue is the development of minimally invasive techniques for proper deposition of semen. This paper discusses the technology currently used in the semen processing and its effects on semen quality, as well as of the AI techniques applied in small ruminants and their success rates.},

	abstract = {Puerperal metritis is an important disorders usually within 21 days postpartum in dairy cattle that occurs within 21 days postpartum, and herbal remedies are believed to be beneficial for postpartum female livestock. Sheng Hua Tang is a prime example of herbal formula used as a therapeutic aid in prevention or control of postpartum disease for centuries in China. In the present study, we were to evaluate the efficacy of Sheng Hua Tang as a prophylactic strategy for lowering puerperal metritis risks and improving reproductive performance in dairy cows under field conditions. A total of 311 clinically healthy cows were randomly allocated to the intervention group or the control group 2-4. h after delivery. Treated cows (n=158) received Sheng Hua Tang with an oral dose of 0.36. g crude herb/kg. bw once daily for three consecutive days, whereas the controls (n=153) received no treatment. The logistic regression and survival analysis were used to analyze the incidence of puerperal metritis and reproduction parameters of cows between the two groups, respectively. The results showed that there was a significant reduction in the incidence of puerperal metritis (12.1% vs. 33.3%, P=0.01, odd ratio [OR] 2.392) between Sheng Hua Tang group and the control group. The calving-to-first-service interval (68.9±17.7 days vs. 80.5±26.6 days, P<0.05) and service per conception (1.7 vs. 2.1, P<0.01) were lower in cows in Sheng Hua Tang group than the controls. Additionally, Sheng Hua Tang treatment effectively elevated the first AI conception proportion (61.1% vs. 51.3%, P<0.05) and proportion of cows that were pregnant at 305 days in milk (89.8% vs. 82.0%, P<0.01) compared with that of controls. The present results would support efforts to the use of Sheng Hua Tang immediately after delivery as a prophylactic strategy for lowering puerperal metritis risk and improving the overall reproductive efficiency of dairy herds under these study circumstances. Thus, Sheng Hua Tang treatment could represent an effective prophylactic strategy for bovine postpartum care. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

C. perfringens causes clostridial myonecrosis (or gas gangrene), enteritis and enterotoxemia in humans and livestock by producing numerous extracellular toxins and enzymes. The toxin gene expression is regulated by a two-component regulatory system and regulatory RNA VirR/VirS-VR-RNA cascade. The VirR/VirS system was originally found in a type A strain, but a recent report showed that it is also important for the toxin gene regulation in other types of strains. Two types of cell-cell signaling, i.e., agr-system and AI-2 signaling, are also important for the regulation of toxin genes. Several regulatory systems independent from the VirR/VirS system, including virX, the orphan histidine kinase ReeS and orphan response regulator RevR, are also involved in the regulation of toxin genes. In addition, the expression of toxin genes is upregulated after contact with Caco-2 cells. C. perfringens has a complex regulatory network for toxin gene expression and thus the coordination of toxin gene expression is important for the process of infection. © 2014 Institut Pasteur.},

	abstract = {Development of computer vision systems is a complex and tedious task requiring the development of algorithms, prototypes and the final system - these three parts are usually made separately. This means the process is slow and the reuse of algorithms developed by others are rare. One way to speed up such system development could be a unification of these three steps as closely as possible. Therefore, a graph-based framework is proposed, which is designed to be fast in three areas - fast prototyping, fast execution and fast visualization. The framework is based on nodes because most computer vision systems can be efficiently broken down into independent algorithm steps and it allows the creation of a computer vision system without writing any code. Fast prototyping is achieved by allowing any part of the system to be added, changed or removed while the system is running without recompiling or interrupting the execution in any other way. The computer vision algorithms themselves are implemented in a scripting language enabling them to be changed and improved at run-time. Fast execution is done through optimizations provided by the graph-based representation. It is possible to disregard blocks that would not contribute to the output or to control when and how data is copied. It is also possible to run the algorithm on GPU using OpenCL thus significantly increasing the performance for computationally intensive calculations. Specific use cases and adoption of computer vision is hindered by the complexity of making a domain specific system, so a framework that allows creating such system - even without coding - is very useful in these automation cases. Current use cases include, but are not limited to, visual landmark based robot localization for an agricultural robot, tracking livestock or measuring certain parameters like shape or size of vegetables. Creation time of such systems is reduced by an order of magnitude using the proposed framework and the resulting system runs on a wide range of hardware - from desktops PC's to embedded devices.},

	abstract = {The ability to regenerate immobilized proteins like recombinant antigens (rAgs) on surfaces is an unsolved problem for flow-based immunoassays on microarray analysis systems. The regeneration on microarray chip surfaces is achieved by changing the protein structures and desorption of antibodies. Afterwards, reactivation of immobilized protein antigens is necessary for reconstitution processes. Any backfolding should be managed in a way that antibodies are able to detect the protein antigens in the next measurement cycle. The regeneration of rAg microarrays was examined for the first time on the MCR3 flow-based chemiluminescence (CL) microarray analysis platform. The aim was to reuse rAg microarray chips in order to reduce the screening effort and costs. An antibody capturing format was used to detect antibodies against zoonotic pathogens in sera of slaughtered pigs. Different denaturation and reactivation buffers were tested. Acidic glycine-SDS buffer (pH 2.5) and 8 M guanidinium hydrochloride showed the best results in respect of denaturation efficiencies. The highest CL signals after regeneration were achieved with a carbonate buffer containing 10 mM DTT and 0.1% BSA for reactivation. Antibodies against Yersinia spp. and hepatitis E virus (HEV) were detected in swine sera on one immunochip over 4 days and 25 measurement cycles. Each cycle took 10 min for detection and regeneration. By using the rAg microarray chip, a fast and automated screening of antibodies against pathogens in sera of slaughtered pigs would be possible for zoonosis monitoring. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In this paper, we propose an automated solution for measuring the daily-life activities of pigs by using video data in order to manage the group-housed pigs. Especially, we focus on the circadian rhythm of group-housed pigs under windowless and 24-hour light-on conditions. Also, we derive a cost-effective solution within the acceptable range of quality for the activity monitoring application.

	abstract = {Biosecurity protocols require a thorough cleaning of trucks and trailers used to transport live pigs. In western Canada, current trailer cleaning practices rely on manual labor and use extensive amounts of water. There exists a significant opportunity to automate the trailer cleaning process to help reduce the labor requirements of the operation, which would then potentially lower the cost to clean a trailer. It is also expected that an automated system will yield more consistent results in terms of cleaning quality. The investigation reported herein was aimed at demonstrating the viability of a vacuum-based system to clean livestock trailers. A wet vacuum system was developed and demonstrated. The estimated capacity of the system suggests that the floor surfaces of a two-level straight trailer can be cleaned in 40 min while using 143 L (31.5 gal) of water. The power requirements of the vacuum system are estimated at 67 kW (90 hp). Several design considerations relevant to automating the system are discussed. © 2015 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.},

Conception rate of frozen semen of three Sahiwal bulls thawed either at 37°C for 45 sec (warm water thaw, WWT) or in ice water at 5°C for 35 min (ice water thaw, IWT) was compared. A total of 301 cows were inseminated in District Mianwali (Pakistan). Overall conception rate (determined by rectal palpation after 45 days of AI) with two thawing methods (WWT, 71.3%; IWT, 68.9%) did not differ (P > 0.05). There was no bull effect (P > 0.05) on the conception rate with WWT and IWT (Bull I, 66.0 and 76.0%; Bull II, 76.0 and 61.2%; Bull III, 71.7 and 69.2%). It is concluded that IWT of Sahiwal bull semen for 35 min did not seem to have adverse effects on cow conception. Copyright 2015 Zoological Society of Pakistan.},

	abstract = {Robotic milking machines are novel technologies that take over the labour of dairy farming and reduce the need for human-animal interactions. Replacing 'conventional' twice-a-day milking managed by people with a system that supposedly allows cows the freedom to be milked automatically whenever they choose, it is claimed that robotic milking has health and welfare benefits for cows, increases productivity, and has lifestyle advantages for dairy farmers. Such claims are certainly contested, but the installation of robotic milkers clearly establishes new forms of relationships between cows, technologies and dairy farmers. This paper draws on in-depth interviews with farmers and observational research on farms to examine relationships between representations of robotic milkers as a technology which gives cows freedom and autonomy, and practices and mechanisms which suggest that bovine life is re-captured and disciplined in important ways through the introduction of this technology. We focus on two issues. First, we explore changes in what it is to 'be bovine' in relation to milking robots, drawing on a combination of a discursive framing of cows' behaviour and 'nature' by dairy farmers and on-farm observation of cow-technology interaction. Second, we examine how such changes in bovinity might be articulated through conceptions of biopower which focus on knowledge of and intervention in the life of both the individual cow body and the herd. Such knowledge and intervention in the newly created sites of the robotic milking dairy are integral to these remodelled, disciplinary farm systems. Here, cows' bodies, movements and subjectivities are trained and manipulated in accordance with a persistent discourse of agricultural productivism. In discussing these issues, the paper seeks to show how particular representations of cows, the production of embodied bovine behaviours, technological interventions and micro-geographies contribute to a re-capturing and re-enclosure of bovine life which counters the liberatory discourses which are used to promote robotic milking. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The global meat industry has seen significant changes in the methods used to harvest and process fresh meat over the past century. Increased use of automation has led to significant increases in line speed for beef, pork, sheep, poultry and fish operations. For example, currently the fastest line observed has been broilers at 13,500/h. Such developments have required in-depth understanding of the pre and post rigor processes to prevent defects. Procedures such as maturation chilling and electrical stimulation are now common in red meat and poultry processing; allowing shorter time to deboning, while harvesting high quality meat. Robots designed to cut meat are also appearing on the market, and replacing traditional manual operations. This is a challenge, because high speed equipment is not necessarily sensitive to variations in size/quality issues, and requires development of unique sensors and control systems. Also, progress in breeding and genetics is contributing to greater product uniformity and quality; helping in operating automated equipment. © 2013.},
